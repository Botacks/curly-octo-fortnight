        <p>The mountain is one of the natural appearances which is undoubtedly its beauty which can also be repurposed as a plain that stands out and rises high from the plains that surround it. Mountains can reach up to hundreds of meters above sea level.

        This altitude also causes the mountain to look beautiful when viewed either from below or from above or at its peak. From the top of the mountain, you can enjoy the freshness of a waterfall that falls from a high cliff flowing a river with clear water flow, the appearance of hills, large rocks, and also solid cliffs, especially if you add a blue sky during the day.

        The beautiful natural appearance of the mountain gives a peaceful and comfortable impression for those who enjoy it. The chirping of beautiful birds in the forest, the cool breeze without pollution, and the splashing of river water between the rocks make anyone who climbs the mountain feel satisfied and doesn't feel any significant fatigue.

        There are several characteristics possessed by mountains. In Indonesia, there are active volcanoes and some are inactive, and Indonesia is famous for its many mountains.

        An active volcano will blow off the lava it has when it erupts. This lava comes from the bowels of the earth and the only way out is the top of the mountain. This lava burns hot like fire. And an inactive volcano has no lava and won't erupt.</p>
        <p>This transaction often occurs in everyday life, it seems impossible that anyone in this world has never made a transaction. Both sale and purchase transactions.

        This transaction is closely related to economic activities such as buying and selling, there are sellers, so of course, there are buyers, and the interactions that occur during the sale and purchase are called transactions.

        This transaction is also divided into several types, such as cash, credit, and loan exchange, and lease transactions. It all depends on the agreement that has been established between one party and the second party.

        This transaction also usually uses proof of transaction in the form of a sheet as evidence that there has been a transaction between party one and part two, but there are also transactions that do not include proof of the transaction.</p>
        <p>Cats are four-legged mammals, cats like to live with humans who love them, cats themselves are very loving and loyal to their owners.

        Cats have types such as Persian cats, Angora cats, local cats, and many more, the difference is in body size, fur, and eyes.

        Cats also have different tails, some cats have long tails, short tails, and there are also curved tails. Cats also have different colors, some cats have one color, some have a combination of two colors and the most interesting one is a cat that has three color combinations.

        Cats like to eat bones, and often some cats like to eat vegetables depending on the master who gave the cat what to eat since the cat was young.</p>
        <p>On Earth, there are many types of flowers, flowers are beautiful plants with attractive colors. Flowers also have a fragrant smell and are different if the flowers are of different types.

        The types of flowers in Indonesia include roses, jasmine, frangipani, cat whiskers, hibiscus and so on which have different shapes, smells, and colors.

        We often find flowers in the yard, on the side of the road and of course in the garden, with flowers some people feel happy to come to see flowers and there are even people who don't like flowers.

        Flowers themselves are not difficult plants to reproduce, with fairly easy-care, this is the reason why flowers often become plants in the home garden.

        Flowers can also be a business field by selling them when they have grown, for weddings, graduations, birthdays, and even funerals.</p>
        <p>I was lost in thought. I think I should sit down for a while to rest. Pity my legs started shaking. Maybe, he was tired of walking with me. I've been trading all day. I was selling and peddling drinking water on the train going to Rangkas Bitung-Jakarta Kota. Usually, when the passengers are crowded, crowded, and crowded, this train is more like a goat pen than a means of transportation. An unpleasant smell was scattered everywhere and mixed with the dry smell of the passengers. My throat feels dry. Hence, I was selling drinks and it was my lucky time. At times like that my merchandise will sell well and I can also make quite a lot of profit. All the proceeds from selling I use to pay for my school and I also give it to my mother for daily needs. That is enough to make me happy because besides being independent I can help my mother.

        However, since the ruling on the merchants on the train five days ago, it has felt as if they had fallen by a ladder as well. How can I not bother? Already living every day, coupled with the prohibition. I was forced to play cat and mouse with the policeman on the train. If my luck is good, I will escape the officers and be able to sell again. If I was arrested by officers, my merchandise would be forcibly thrown away and the money I had sold would have to be handed over as a fine for breaking the rules. Every time I sell on the train, I'm always worried. But, if I don't sell, I will be confused thinking about my school fees.

        As a minor, I was very confused. The government seems to be impartial to the little people. Indeed, sometimes I also realize that the restructuring is also done for the good of the passengers and the comfort of the passengers. However, the officers shouldn't throw away and demand fines from merchants who are fortunately not quite like me. I hope that the government will provide land to sell with lots of buyers so that my friends and I can sell in peace.</p>
        <p>This holiday is very memorable for me. My father took me on vacation to my grandmother's house in a village in Solok Regency, West Sumatra. It's been a long time since I visited my grandmother's village. So the opportunity to go on vacation to my grandmother's house excited me.

        At eight o'clock in the morning, I left with my father. My father rode a motorcycle and I rode behind. After traveling several tens of kilometers, we finally arrived at Grandma's house.

        The next day, my father's nephew invited me to go to my grandmother's rice field. Incidentally that day my grandmother was harvesting rice. Grandma's rice field is not far from the house. In just a few minutes I arrived at my grandmother's rice field. Many people are harvesting rice in Grandma's rice field. Some are mowing the rice. Some thresh grain with rice thresher tools.

        On the third day, my father invited me to his old friend's house on the edge of Lake Singkarak. My father's friend's house is on the edge of the lake so you can freely see the beauty of Lake Singkarak. The second largest lake on the island of Sumatra after Lake Toba in North Sumatra.

        The following days I passed with fun. Join in playing with friends in the village. They turned out to be very friendly and sociable. I felt as if I had been hanging out with them for a long time.

        On the last day, I felt reluctant to leave grandma's village. The village is lush, the people are friendly and like to work together. I feel like I want to stay in Grandma's village but it's impossible. In the afternoon I returned home with my father.

        I was at my grandmother's house a full week on holiday. Very nice experience. If there is a chance for school holidays in the next period, I ask my father to return to vacation at grandma's house.</p>
        <p>In the house, there is a Persian cat named Milo. Milo is my only pet cat.

        Milo has an active nature and is quite spoiled. He loves to be caressed gently while sleeping on my lap.

        One of Milo's habits is to always greet me when I return home. He even always stayed at the door when I opened the door. Then he will immediately follow me to the room and put the bag on the table.

        Because every day I had to study, I immediately lay down on the bed after coming home.

        Milo once accompanied me when I lay down. I also never forget to stroke his head. Sometimes we both fall asleep accidentally late at night.

        Not only likes to be around me, but Milo also has a hobby of eating. Milo's food portion is even bigger than mine. He is very fond of cheddar cheese. But Milo also really likes milk.

        But I often give him packaged food. I did this to reduce costs. Because the price of cheese is more expensive than the price of packaged cat food.

        So that only occasionally I will give him food in the form of cheese. When Milo ate cheese, he would eat it so heartily that he used up nearly 500 grams of cheese for one meal. As for milk, I do give it regularly.

        Milo has quite long and thick hair. Milo's coat color is white. Milo's body is also very fast and also full. Milo's nose is very flat, almost invisible, and hidden by his chubby face.

        Milo is a gift from my grandmother on my 10th birthday. At first, I didn't like the gift, but after getting to know Milo's nature I became very fond of him.

        Milo's character isn't too wild either. He is included in the type of cat who is quiet and does not act much. That's why I like Milo so much.</p>
        <p>My house has a size that is not too big but not too small. This one house belongs to my family, which was bought long before my father married my mother.

        This simple house is in front of the prayer room in the first block from the front gate of the Citra Kirana housing complex.

        Various types of plants planted in this mini garden include vegetables such as kale, chilies, mustard greens, and onions and white.

        All types of plants have been bearing fruit a lot. I'm very comfortable with my house.</p>
        <p>A watch is an accessory that is worn on the wrist, just like wearing a bracelet. However, this watch accessory is much more effective and functional. Not only that, but watches can also be used as a means of supporting appearance.

        While the binder section has a varied design. Some wear ribbons, rubber, magnets, leather, and others.

        As a functional accessory, now the clock has also become one of the innovative items. There are even smartphones that have the size of a watch. The way to wear it is the same as wearing a watch.

        Then the watch is also equipped with a waterproof feature. So it doesn't die easily even though it's exposed to water and is very safe to use when it's raining or swimming.

        Therefore, the waterproof feature in this watch is a favorite feature. It is also a major feature that must be present on every watch.</p>

        <p>Ajkwa Island, which is located at the mouth of the Ajkwa River, Mimika, Papua, is one of several groups of mangrove forest islands in it.

        This one forest has not been touched by industrial greed that is being experienced by various mangrove forests in other areas.

        This island was formed in the early 1990s, which has a wealth of flora and fauna that can add insight to every visitor through tours while learning.

        The creation of Ajkwa Island began with an increase in high sedimentation at the mouth of the Ajkwa River. This intensive deposition then resulted in the tailings flow escaping from the Ajkwa deposition area and forming several new lands at the mouth of the Ajkwa River. Most of this land has been overgrown with mangroves.

        Based on satellite data, this one island began to grow mangroves in 1997 and only became a fairly stable island in 2000.

        Two mangrove species were recorded in the tree category, six mangrove species in the belt category, as well as the mangrove species in the sapling category.

        Where the total number of mangrove species on this island is fourteen species.

        The density of mangroves is 126 trees / hectare, 1,051 belta / hectare, and 643 tillers / hectare.

        Apart from plants, this island is also inhabited by several aquatic animals such as crustaceans (crabs & shrimp), mollusks (snails), and worms.

        Not only that, there are as many as 30 species of crustaceans, 4 species of mollusks, and 7 families of worms, which breed in this island region.

        This shows that some of these animals can live and grow in areas that contain tailings. These animals do not have a skeleton, so they cannot save themselves if there is an environmental threat in their area.

        That means the environment on the island around the Ajkwa River is not polluted by waste like in other areas.

        This animal community also increases every time.

        The mangrove forests on Ajkwa Island have formed a living ecosystem. Various marine life that lives there also provoke the arrival of various types of birds.

        Some of the birds that live there are also beautifully colored. Therefore, when you go there, don't forget to bring binoculars.

        From this binocular lens, you can later observe the beautiful shape and color of the bird perched on a tree branch.

        Birds chirping can also be heard loudly shouting as if they want to enliven this uninhabited island.

        There are odd-shaped birds like the great-billed heron, which are small but with long beaks and necks.

        There is also a red-headed myzomela with redhead-to-tail feathers and black wings.

        And there are also all the colorful limbs of the rufous-night heron. This type of bird has a black head with a white crest. On the neck to the stomach has a white color but a pair of brown wings. Both legs are yellow.

        Interestingly, Ajkwa Island might become a dead island if it is not inhabited by parrots and golden whistler mangroves.

        This loud chirp is what manages to break the silence on the island.</p>
        <p>Balqis felt frustrated with his over-ideal body weight. He felt that he was very fat and not beautiful because of the large amount of fat stuck to his body. After asking his friend, Balqis decided to go to a beauty doctor. She hopes to have an ideal body weight, which makes her always beautiful and attractive in the eyes of many people.

        "I want to have a slim weight, beautiful and sexy like Korean artist Lee Sung Kyung, doc!", Said Balqis to the beauty doctor he visited while showing the artist's photo on his cellphone. The beauty doctor frowned when he saw a photo of a Korean artist that was shown by his client. The doctor seemed doubtful about the wishes of his patient.

        Seeing the doctor's doubt, made Balqis give him an ultimatum. "Anyway, I have to be slim like Lee Sung Kyung, doc. I don't care how. Doctors have to do their best for me ”.

        The beauty doctor finally decided to examine Balqis. After examining the patient, the doctor shook his head. The doctor also said that in fact, Balqis' health condition was already very bad. Even Balqis' life span is less than 2 weeks.

        Hearing this, made Balqis shocked and hysterical. He also cried out of the doctor's beauty clinic. However, 2 weeks later Balqis returned to the clinic and berated the doctor. "The doctor is lying. The doctor said I was less than 2 weeks old. Now it's been more than 2 weeks but I'm still alive, ”said Balqis.

        Instead, the doctor smiled at his patient and said, “It's miraculous, Miss Balqis. What have you done during these 2 weeks to make your body slim like this? ”. Finally, Balqis also told what he had been doing for the last 2 weeks.

        "Because I thought about what the doctor said, I had no appetite for food for the past 2 weeks," said Balqis. Then the doctor responded. “Now, Miss Balqis, enjoy your ideal body. Those's the most effective diet tips for you.</p>
        <p>A few days ago Pak Prasojo was driving his ferry to go visit his friend out of town. But on the way, Pak Prasojo was surprised when he saw a woman eating grass on the side of the road. So far, Mr. Prasojo has known that humans only eat rice, not grass. Finally, Pak Prasojo decided to stop the car and approached the mother.

        Pak Prasojo also asked the woman. "Sorry mom. Why are you eating grass? ". With a pitiful face, the mother answered Pak Prasojo's question. "I'm hungry, sir. But, I don't have money to buy food. Hearing this answer, Pak Prasojo felt pity. He also asked the grass-eating mother to get into his luxury car.

        However, the rump-eating mother refused Pak Prasojo's request. "Sorry, Sir. I can't get in the car. I have seven children at home and they are eating grass together, ”explained the mother. Pak Prasojo immediately replied, "Just take it to the mother's seven children".

        Immediately the mother became excited after hearing Pak Prasojo's answer. He also called all his children to get into Pak Prasojo's luxury car. When in the car, the children become absurdly happy. Finally, they can ride a luxury car like the one owned by Pak Prasojo.

        On the way, one of the children asked Pak Prasojo. "Where are you taking us?". Mr. Prasojo answered the boy's question, "Of course I will bring you to my house," replied Pak Prasojo in a friendly manner. Hearing Pak Prasojo's answer made the children even happier.

        "Why do you want to take us home?" Asked one of the children. Everyone seemed enthusiastic to hear Pak Prasojp's answer, who was busy driving. "Of course, because the grass in my house is getting long. You can eat the grass to your heart's content! ”.</p>
        <p>That night Mr. Paino was going for a walk on his motorbike to buy meatballs. He rode his motorbike through Jalan Kenanga, which was bright with the street lights. However, suddenly Pak Paino was startled by a whistle from a policeman who was not far from him. He felt doubtful because usually there were no raids at night. However, he finally stopped the motorbike.

        Pak Paino parked his motorbike on the side of the road. Not long ago, the same policeman also parked his motorbike near Pak Paino's motorbike. With an annoyed expression, Pak Paino asked the young policeman. "What's the matter, sir? Why did I get stopped like this? ”Asked Pak Paino, curious about the police's treatment.

        "We apologize for disturbing the speed of your vehicle. However, you need to know that your lights don't turn on. It's night, sir. It is very dangerous if you don't turn on your motorcycle lights. The new regulation is that every vehicle driving during the day must turn on the headlights, ”explained the police.

        "Oh, sir. This is Kenanga Street. Do you not see here that many of the street lamps are lit? What do I need to turn on my motorcycle lights? It's so bright like this, really! ”, Said Pak Paino not wanting to lose. However, the police also did not want to be outdone by Pak Paino's argument. "Still, sir. It is mandatory to turn on the motorcycle lights while driving ”.

        Pak Paino did not accept the police statement. However, suddenly the policeman looked down and pulled the small cover of Mr. Paino's motorcycle tire. Of course, this made Mr. Paino's motorcycle tires flat. "Why did you deflate my motorbike tire?" Asked Mr. Paino in panic. "No need to panic, sir. There's a lot of wind here. Just use the wind around here for your motorcycle tires.

        The police also left Pak Paino and failed to get the ticket. Meanwhile, Pak Paino became confused because his motorcycle tire was flat. Pak Paino also regretted his haphazard answer. He promised not to repeat the same thing.</p>
        <p>Budi just ate meatballs at Pak Bambang's place. After chatting for a while with Pak Bambang, he went home on his motorbike. The journey from Pak Bambang's meatball shop to Budi's house is not that far. However, because he was lazy he decided to just ride a motorbike.

        On the way to his house, the motorbike that Budi was riding was caught by another motorcycle. The motorcyclist who grazed Budi immediately fled. Budi yells at the culprit in annoyance. Luckily, he didn't get the slightest abrasions. Unfortunately, the new sandals he was wearing were broken. The flip-flops strap just broke.

        Budi chuckled irritably. Instantly he became worried because if he came home later, he would be scolded by his mother. Mrs. Budi is very fierce and likes to get angry. Therefore, Budi intends not to go home without sandals. Moreover, the money has run out to buy meatballs at Pak Bambang's place earlier.

        A moment later, Budi looks around where he had been grazed earlier. It turned out that not far from the place, he found a mosque where so many sandals were plastered on the lawn. What a fortunate coincidence for Budi. What's more, he sees a pair of sandals that look very similar to Budi's broken sandals.

        Without thinking, Budi immediately rushed to the mosque. He tried to be as careful as possible so that no one saw his action when he took the sandal. When he felt safe, Budi quickly took the sandals.

        Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Budi, someone found out about his evil actions. A mosque congregation caught Budi's behavior and immediately reported it to the nearest police station. Budi was immediately asked to undergo a trial.

        While Budi is waiting for his turn for trial, he also sees a corruptor being convicted by a judge. The corruptor has committed corruption of 5 billion rupiahs and was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 days. Until then, it is Budi's turn to undergo a trial.

        The judge stated that Budi had stolen sandals worth 30 thousand rupiahs and caused losses to the sandal owner. Meanwhile, the corruptors managed to corrupt funds amounting to 5 billion rupiahs, the losses were divided among all Indonesian people, totaling 200 million people. This means that every citizen loses as much as 25 rupiahs.

        Hearing the explanation from the trial judge, made Budi feel sad and sorry. Budi feels sad and sorry why he doesn't just become a corruptor.</p>
        <p>At 4 p.m., Mada has come home from school. This afternoon he got a Geography lesson from Mr. Kautsar which discussed the countries in the world. Mada was so curious whether his mother had visited any countries in the world or not. Mada is looking for his mother to ask about this curious thing.

        After searching, it turned out that his mother was lying on the floor mattress in the family room. Ibu Mada looks so very sleepy after a long day of work. However, Mada didn't seem to care about it. Mada asked his mother, "Mom, have you ever traveled the world?" Mrs. Mada replied, "Yes, I have."

        Hearing his mother's answer, made Mada even more enthusiastic. "Wow, have you ever been to England?", Asked Mada again. Mrs. Mada immediately replied, "Yes, I have." Mada was amazed again. He is increasingly enthusiastic about his mother's world tour issues. "Have you ever been to South Korea? France? South Africa? Zimbabwe? ”Asked Mada with sparkling eyes.

        Annoyed by her daughter's continuing questions, finally, Mada's mother became furious. He immediately got up and cursed Mada. "Go on, go away. Take a shower, change clothes and eat! ”, Shouted Mada's mother. "But, I still want to know", Mada replied pitifully.

        “Mother has been around the world. My mother has stepped on France, South Africa, South Korea, Zimbabwe, and even North Korea. What I have never stepped on is your nagging mouth. Now do your mother's orders quickly before the palm broom floats! ”Said, Mother. Hearing this, Mada immediately ran away to carry out his mother's orders.</p>
        <p>Aji is confiding in his friend, Wahyu. According to Aji, the love he got was not fair at all. At first, Wahyu was lazy to hear Aji's remarks because he was bored with his love story. However, in the end, he wanted to hear Aji's remarks after seeing Aji's face battered to fight for his love.

        "So, why is your face so battered like this?", Investigated Wahyu. “Listen carefully to my story, Yu. I will tell you everything ", replied Aji. Wahyu also began to listen to the story from Aji.

        "You see Eko, he has a girlfriend who is a nurse who works in a well-known hospital in this city. No wonder, now Eko looks well-groomed, ”said Aji making Wahyu nod his head. "Well, you see the Doni. Now his girlfriend is a math teacher. No wonder he is smart now, "continued Aji. Wahyu nodded in agreement with Aji's words.

        "Then, let me guess. Must be your boyfriend, a boxer, right? Or a karate and kung fu expert? That's why your face is so battered like this, ”commented Wahyu. However, Aji shook his head instead. "Wrong. My boyfriend is a clothes designer, Yu. He is very good at designing various kinds of attractive clothes, ”Aji informed him.

        “What has a clothes designer to do with your battered face? As far as I know, which clothes designer can beat a person like this, ”said Wahyu. "It's not my boyfriend who makes my face so battered, Yu. But… ”, Aji held his breath for a moment. "But, what?", Investigated Wahyu. "But, what makes me so battered like this is her husband, Yu". Without further ado, Wahyu beat Aji in the face.</p>
        <p>On-campus, two girls are close friends, Irma and Salma. Since the two of them became friends, Irma often asked Salma for help, especially about money. Irma often borrowed money from Salma, even from other friends.

        When in trouble with financial rights, Irma always asks for help from her friends. However, when he was charged Irma avoided it. He is often much fiercer than his friends who collect debts.

        One day, Salma had to do her college assignments, which had piled up in three days. Salma is confused about completing all her duties because at the same time she has a family event that cannot be left behind.

        In this confusion, Irma came to Salma. He wanted to return to borrow money from Salma. I don't know how many times Irma has borrowed money from Salma. "Sal, can I borrow money from you again?" Asked Irma with a pleading tone. "How many Ir?" Asked Salma. "Not much, Sal. Only one million, ”said Irma, making Salma surprised.

        "So many, Ir? Your debt alone is more than the amount you are willing to borrow from me. Now, do you want to borrow some more? ”Salma asked in a curt tone. "Duh, sorry. But, this time I need money. I'll return it soon. All the same as yesterday's debts ", said Irma.

        A moment later, Salma had the initiative. "Let's make it like this. You did my job for 3 days, later I will lend you money. Agree? I happen to have a family event that I can't leave, ”said Salma. With a sigh, Irma agreed to Salma's request, "Okay".

        Three days later, Irma came to Salma's class to submit her assignment while asking for a loan. "Sal, this is your job is finished. So, where is your loan money? ”Asked Irma without further ado. While accepting the assignment given by Irma and examining it, Salma spoke to Irma. "Previously, I'm sorry Ir. Try now to calculate in advance how much you owe? ”.

        "What do you mean?", Investigated Irma. “The amount you owe is even more than a million. Well, just think of me as the friend who understands you the most. So, I consider my tasks that you are doing as paying off your debts so far. Instead of you having to return it in the form of money I don't know when you can return it to me. Break-even, huh? ", Said Salma.

        Hearing Salma's words, made Irma just keep quiet. Even though in his heart, Irma was extraordinary. Moreover, in that class, many friends heard Salma's words.</p>
        <p>Agung, Ageng, and Burhan are three best friends since they were little. They often spend time together. Until one day while playing, the three of them have the intention of meeting a pet parrot of one of their neighbors who lives in the corner of the alley.

        The parrot is unique. Every time someone passes by, the bird always says the names of the colors. Agung, Ageng, and Burhan suspected that it could be that the parrot mentioned the colors of the clothes of the people they saw. For this reason, the three friends agreed to wear the same shirt when they met the parrot.

        Sure enough, when they met the parrot, the parrot immediately said, "White, white, white". Hearing the parrot's words made Agung, Ageng and Burhan amazed. The next day, they came back wearing the same t-shirts when they met their neighbor's parrot.

        The parrot said, "Yellow, yellow, yellow". They were amazed again at the words of the parrot. Until a moment later, Agung had a pretty ridiculous idea. "What if we don't wear shirts tomorrow? Just wear pants? What do you think this parrot wants to respond to, huh? ”. Ageng and Burhan agree with Agung's absurd idea.

        The next day, Agung, Ageng, and Burhan met the parrot without wearing a t-shirt like what Agung said yesterday. For a moment, the three friends were excited and laughed at the parrot's confused expression. However, a moment later the parrot said to the three of them, "Thin, thin, fat".

        Hearing the parrot's words, the three of them immediately got angry. Especially Agung who has a fat body posture like a Japanese wrestler.</p>
        <p>One day, a street sweeper was doing his job. He was sweeping the courtyard of an office building with great care and cleanliness. Not long after, a man with a fashionable appearance passed by the yard throwing trash in front of the sweeper.

        "Hey, young man. I'm sweeping. Don't you see it? I am working to support my family at home, ”said the sweeper. However, the man who took out the trash was just silent even though he had turned around.

        “Son, can you just throw the trash in the trash? I've already swept this page, ”said the sweeper. Suddenly the man who took out the trash looked confused. "Oh, sorry sir. I thought this was a trash can. Wow, it looks like I've been hallucinating, ”the man said innocently.

        "You are told that you are annoying," said the sweeper. "Really sir. I think this page is a trash can. That's why I throw garbage here. I just realized when my father reprimanded me just now. Sorry, Sir". After hearing this explanation, the sweeper left the man who took out the garbage. He also muttered, "Huh, there are people today."</p>

I found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long. I'm movin' on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces. Each one is different but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it, they'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong. I'm moving on.^^ hum that reminds me of the Stephanie thing a little --grr made me MAD.^^At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me, and I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyone's life, when all you can see are the years passing by, and I've made up my mind that those days are gone...^^ 1*20*04 and now for the little kiddies out there..a STORY! ~This is about a little midget man's adventure! (no offense to any midgets). A little midget man sat under a bridge. "Oh no! Oh no!" said a frog in the creek. "The evil troll is going to come and bite off your ears!" he told the little midget man. "Whaaat?!? froggy, froggy, froggy you're obviously mental -trolls do NOT exist! It's all your imagination." said little midget man. Then from the forest came a big ugly troll stomping through the grass. His hair was green and his eyes were red. He had humongous feet - longer then his arms! "ARRRGH!" he roared. "Who is under my bridge!!!?!? I CAN HEAR YOU!!!" "oh no! I told you there was a troll! I told you!!!" squealed the little froggy. The little midget man said calmly "No problem!" he pushed a button on his coat and wooosh! Jet pack! The blue fire spurted out of the bottom of the pack in two long flames. The little midget man flew into the sky. He was going all over, circling, circling, circling. While in the sky he ran into a pretty bluebird. The bluebird yelled "Ahh! Watch where you're going!!" They rammed into each other and came tumbling down into the woods.--thats as far as I got sorry kiddies lol. I wrote it today 4th period in English.

Okay I'll come back and add to this later tonight. WOOOOOOOSH!!! Okay, ya know what I notice is that I have the same old problem a lot. I seem to be able to get along with many different kinds of people. The different kinds of people I can get along with tend to not get along with each other. I've found that this is a common problem for me. The people I'm friends with don't get along, they don't like each other, then they want me to choose between them..ouch..usually hard not always but sometimes yeah it is because I don't want to have to choose between them geez gosh people always so competitive. Yeah just thought I'd say that because it's something that I've noticed over the many years (ooo 14) that I've been alive. Holly Toledo I'm 14 thats old geez I remember in the days that I thought 14 was ancient. One time I remember arguing with my mom about candy bars I wanted a candy bar but she said no you can't have a candy bar but she got one. Then I complained because she got one and I didn't then she said when I get old and have a job then I can buy my own candy bars...huh I was little like 7 or 8 lol then yeah I really really wanted to be old so I could have candy bars..lol. Interesting isn't it? Yeah thanks. 3 more days and it will be my 10 day anniversary since I started the LTE! wooooooo! lol cool. :D Alright 1 of the kids is here now, yip! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

Okay in respondence (lol um yeah) to Al's LTE I'm going to say that I used to watch a movie with a rabbit who ate worms and yeah I think it was The Big Rock Candy Mountains??? and I used to eat chocolate koala bears but now they're pretty much impossible to find and very costly -oh it's a sad life. "Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive." hum yep yep. I think Al's LTE might be beating mine now..MAN! lol I got to keep up! arr! it's difficult though because I don't have much to ramble about since my life is so boring and my brain is so small lol. OPE! guess what everyone I'm reading a BOOK. yep I am really REALLY lol cool eh? HAW yeah I know.. It's called Breathing Underwater by Alex Flinn and it's about some popular guy who has a good life pretty much except that his dad used to abuse him. He had this I guess really good girlfriend and he slapped her once and she took him to court and got a restraining order. I don't know I'm only on page 59 out of 263 so yeah but it's okay, it's pretty easy though not very challenging to your brain the words aren't hard or anything lol. Well at least I can understand it and I'll finish it in the 3 week period that I have, I hope. I only read it during school never read at home so yeah I might have to cram a bunch in at the last minute. I'm somewhat interested in the story it isn't terrible the abuse thing is interesting to me I like reading about that but still it's READING which I haven't done recreationally for quite a while but this isn't recreational since I have to write a book report on it. I have wanted a book though because I always seem to have free time in classes where I'm bored and so I can sit and read now but ever since I got new classes for the new semester I haven't had as much free time as I did to last semester. Stinks, I can't write note as often..cept in study hall I guess. Also I'd like to complain that they are making us take swimming a SECOND TIME (Evil) WHY do we have to take it twice?? Why don't they just put it all in one big clump and get it OVER WITH! I guess because of the girls having their periods so missing 2 weeks (approx.) instead of 1..but still ICK why do we even have to take it two times why not just once? I'd also like to say that yes most girls can wear tampons easily..I don't know how they do it..yes I'm sorta weird but I don't wanna stick anything up there it freaks me out ew what if it gets stuck or something and I can't get it out!!?!?! eeee lol yes I am immature but yeah skip it I don't care. I'm not the only person I know with this problem! I've heard that you're supposed to find the right 'angle' eheh eheh uh angle? oookaay and yuck when you pull it out does it all drip and sploosh all over the place?? and if it's made of cotton then can little pieces sorta fly off and then they just sit in there? and I mean if it's INSIDE of you then when you walk can you feel it rub against your insides??? I mean all these questions and I don't have the answers and sometimes idk if I WANT TO KNOW. OOOOHHH well. Feel free to email me with any answers you have. I feel really kiddish for asking this stuff like I'm old and I should know but yeah I don't lol I think I'm pretty immature for my age..HEHE XD good for me! Just got a phone call I guess the other cousin is coming over now too..yep yip yep yip. I didn't know if she was coming or not but now she is! not gonna make a difference though she just sits and does homework anyway. Then Danielle just plays with my brothers so it's pretty easy. I think that I've done a good job rambling today, I actually had a good topic that I can just type and type and type about lol without having to think about what I was gonna say about it, just flooooows out of ya sometimes. Okay I have this really annoying canker sore on my gum and a cut on my toungue owwie PAIN! Josh told me to add SALT to it lol (yeah I know what you're thinking OW) yeah it sorta hurts a little bit EHEM lol but it sorta worked...except mine is in the worst place because it hurts whenever I talk cuz it's right in the space where your lip attatches to your gum so ow my gum rubs accross it whenver I talk eck stinks. 1*27*03 HELLO ALL EVERYONE...welcome to my chambers MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAH what interesting things happened today? nothing that I can think of. My life is so boring. My stupid canker sore still hurts. My friends are weird. Josh told me to put salt on it, now Al told me to put ear wax on it LOL...eh taking a quick little break I's a be back! -------THIS MARKS THE SPOT THAT THE HERMNERP ALLIANCE WAS FORMED!!!YAY CELEBRATE MT.DEWS ALL AROUND!------- 1*27*04 *AL* WOOHOO Yipper Skipper me and Tiff got an LTE that is gonna be very very loooong!!! 1*28*04 *TIFF* WOOOP! WOOOP! here we go! dun dun dun, it is 7:02 aweeeesoooome. Well here's the deal okay so me and Al both started LTE's ya see and somehow mine got on to hers like where my ENTIRE LTE page was on her LTE page and totally erased all of her rambling and her lovely story about the old man...tragic isn't it??? WELL we decided to make an LTE together that would be TWICE as long as the other ones (AND it will be, you just wait!) I decided to give it a kick-off this morning with a little rambling of my own. SO I'm planning on erasing my LTE so I can spend my full undevided rambling to THIS one. doo doo! I got like 15 minutes left to just ramble ramble ramble! YaY! I probably won't spend 15 minutes HERE rambling though because I'm supposed to be getting ready to go to school. (oh yippity skippity school BLAH) Well I'll probably just have to type later so yeah gotta go get ready (put my socks on lol) for school! adios! I'll type when I get home. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!

HEHEHEHHEHEEHEHEH!okay nvm HEHEHE I'm back hum hum me and Josh are gonna watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail cuz Al let me borrow it..thanks...lol yeeeah. 1*28*04 *AL* OOOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEEEAH I'm all revved up and ready to get this brand new LTE going!!!!!! Ok, so I sort of came in during the middle but who cares????? WHO TOOK MY OTHER LTE???????? It was a good one cuz it had this great story about an old man....... that was two days ago... now it has dissappeared into some other celestial world....hmmmmm... I wanna watch Monty Python!!!! Nothing to do tonight.. so sad. I haven't seen that forever- only like once. But Ilike the torso dude! I will bite off your amrs and legs!!! this fight is not over!! We are the knights who say NEEEEE! Bring us a srubbery! So anyways.... yeah okay I'm bored... I get bored VERY easily... maybe I have ADHD who knows??? That would be sort of cool though ya know??? Oh yeah today I was on complete withdrawl from Mt. Dew because ya know I hadn't had it since Monday which is a really long time for me.. TWO DAYS!! Gah the torture! But anyways after school I had to stay for play practice and being me I was completely broke- so I told my friend Stacie to tell my mom that i was on complete withdrawl from Mt. Dew and ihad a HUGE headache and I was dying! So she did, and after much much much convintion from Stacie my mom brought me $1.25!!!! Isn't that great??? So I got my Mt. Dew after all! I was soooo happy! 20 great oz of delicious yummy great Mt. Dew. But now I found out that it only costs $1.10 at school instead of $1.25 so I got back 15 cents how wonderful!!! Oh I am hyper!!! Heh yesterday I got a T shirt for Asian club which is supposed to have BAMBOO on the back but instead somebody made it to look like WEED! Isn't that great geez and the School made them- what a great role model. lol. Hm I'm sorta cold. ya know it's cold all lonely down here in my basement because I am a deprived child who doesn't have a computer in her room . Waaaa oh well I'll get over it. Shooby Doo. WOOOOOOOOOOSH YEEEEEEEEEEAH! Guess what??? I CAN FLY!!!! I really really can! For real! Nobody believes but I can. Tiff should belive me cuz we're sorta childish like that heh heh he but she dosn't! All I want is one beliver!!! Jus one!!! Email us if you belive me!!!! Ok actually everyone email e and tell me yes or no and then after a while I'll tell you the results- like how many people belive me and how many don't. Hm I might update you every day maybe too. So anyways here's the story. when I was about 5 or E my grandma pulliam would babysit me and my brother after school on Fridays. This is the only time I could fly- when she babysat on a Friday. So I would stand at the top of my stairs- there were about 30 of them- and i would blink my eyes and be at the bottom. So it was like a flying/transporting type thing. But me and my brother still remember it to this day. Cuz he would watch me do it and be like WOAH! I did it twice. And that's the story!!! i think it's pretty believable..... how about ya'll????? i KNOW it happened too- It WASN'T a dream!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO how would me and my brother both have the same EXACT dream??? Just way too weird... But I've been having a lot of de ja vu lately.. de ja vu is soo much fuun- HAH sort of creepy but fun!!!!!

You think I don't know what you're thinking..but I DO lol and I don't appreciate it much..gar. Oh well. You know the snow is nice on Christmas but I think once Christmas is over it shouldn't snow again until like..December lol. Thats how the weather should be snow just 1 month and it has to rain at least 1 day out of every week..I love rain. I'm looking forward to summer in 4 more months..just to get school off! and I kinda miss the sunshine a little bit. I really like summer at nighttime with all the lightning bugs and it's really nice and peaceful..just thinking of it makes me happy. Like sitting on the porch with a couple friends and looking at the lightning bugs maybe catching a few and pulling there butts off (ALLISON lol) or just name them and let them go. You have to name them when you catch them don't just catch them. I also have a fettish of naming fire hydrants. My favorite fire hydrant is over by what used to be a big field with a bunch of trees where people always rode bikes but they sorta screwed it up, stupid people always do that. Wouldn't it be freakin awesome to live before there were any roads, sidewalks, cars and buildings?? I think it would be awesome! I'd like to go back to see what it was like lol...what is was like when everyone wore loin cloths. Too bad, it would be cool to still live like the indians did (in my opinion..but don't just listen to ME! send YOUR opinions!!!:D we'd love to hear from you!) 1*29*04 *AL* Ok yeah I was reading through the LTE and I noticed I spell a lot of crap wrong so just CONFIRMING that I'm not stupid and I do know how to spell (most of the time) and I DO know that BELIEVE is spelled BELIEVE and NOT BELIVE ok??? yeah just making sure so yeah hey start glazer your I wish Iwish Iwas a Fish is awesome cuz I kept saying it today and annoying people! Mwahahahaahhaahah man I got homework to do then off to show choir practice then back here to finish homework and take a shower and clean the house blaaaah I hate when my nights are pre planned out with crap I gotta do. I just wanna play on the computer all night... ARGH- ARGH is awesome cuz I say it all the time like in real life ya know??? Oh yea hthere has been no results to the survey because uh duh nobody's visited our website besides me and Tiff but I guess Tiff could have responded but she didn't- oh well she SAYS she believes me but I don't know if I can trust her... lol ya know what i want to accomplish in my life????? Not something great but I WANNA MEET MY TWIN!!! Not my REAL twin cuz I don't got one- but ya know how they always say that everyone has a twin somewhere in the world?? well, I wanna meet mine- that would be oh so much fun!!! watcha guys think? haha I don't know I believe in weird stuff. lol LADEDA ok I like chicken- chicken is good yum yum yum yum I wonder where everyone is???? because once again I am all by my lonesome... awwwww maaaaaan I feel so alone.. heeh no really. Hmmm man I'm not really in a rambling mood today!! Oh yeah I did get another Mt. Dew today after school cuz Kjirstin bought me one cuz I was going insane but it was only a can- 12 oz. It's actually cheaper to buy two cans of Mt. Dew than a bottle cuz for $1.00 you can get 24 oz in cans and with $1.00 you can get 20 oz with a bottle. See? more with the cans. Plus it tastes a lot better out of a can. Um ok I sort of have to eat something before I go to practice cuz ya know I'm kinda hungry???? So yeah gonna eat and stuff maybe work on my crap science homework who knows??? i hate science blah blah blah see ya round town........ Bad boys bad boys watcha gonna do? watcha gonna do when they come for you???

Oh and we'd have Mt.Dew and some food..idk what..like...quesadillas or something YUM!Okey Dokey Josh decided to make a website too, the LTE is making a difference! such an inspirational peice of work isn't it???? 1*30*04 HEY! man January is almost over yeesh..time just flies doesn't it. One time I figured this out okay, days go by soooo slow (well, the ones when you're at school) but weeks fly by really fast and months yeah they go by kinda fast..before you even notice the month is over! lol thats what happened this month man I mean it's February now. I got stuff to do this weekend though to thats good lol don't gotta be bored! woop! Usually on weekends I do stuff now, not just sit at home like I used to..hah wow that was sad. I used to be pretty depressed and lonely and angry. I was looking through some of my old notebooks in like E grade and yeah ARRR!! anger, and 7th even too I was pretty angry and even in 8th grade I was more then I am now. Now I am happy lalalalala! lol I feel happy, I know GOOD FOR ME right..hehe YEP! ^^Here I go again on my own ner ner ner ner going down the only road I've ever known, like a drifter I was born to walk alone...and I've made up my mind..I ain't wastin no more time!^^ I always sing that song. HUM well I'm gonna go eat (7:10) need to leave in 10 minutos about so yeah need something to eat..even though that will just make me hungrier all day. That always happens I eat but it doesn't make me full until lunch it just makes me hungry for more food. Once I start eating I want more and more and more lol. Stupid crunchy spicy chickens again yesterday hopefully they're not today. Well okay gonna go now then..adiadi. 1*30*04 *AL* HELLO! yeah I feel kinda BAD cuz I'm not a full fledge contributor like Tiff is cuz she writes much much more than I do.... I don't have that much TIME see? tomorrow i got a show choir competition and then I gt to babysit and then Sunday I gotta go to church and then get Gala stuff and then babysit some more... sorry duder heh but I'll be bback sometime soon... yeah. Nobody has responded to our surveys.. how sad.. not even Josh and I thought he read this??? What the heck? where is everyone when you need them? ok I'll be back in like 10 minitos but to you it will seem like nothing ya know.....ok I'm back- had to unload the dishwasher...yum I got a cinnamo pop tart while I was up there too- HAH retart tart tart like a POP TART! lalala I'm having so much fun..AHH I got a crumble inside the keyboard! hehe man I can't even think of anything to ramble about? what shall i ramble about who knows who knows... I WISH I WISH I WAS A FISH! and I really can fly ya know......well could. I'm gonna go check our email real quick- maybe somebody answered our survey!!! :D ok sad news.. NO MAIL-NONE WHATSOEVER!!! !GAHHHHH I'm really beginning to thinkthat this website reaches NO ONE!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I had this great idea where we could advertise it by makin glittle advertisments on the computer and then going to like Wal- MArt or somewhere and sticking them into the top-selling magazines and then when people bought the magazine they'd see the advertisement for our website and be like "Hey! That sounds like FUN! i've always wanted to read the Longest Text Ever!!!" Then we'd have lots of visitors and who knows maybe the guiness book of world records guy would buy a magazine with one in it and we'd be discovered except I think flaming Chicken's is way longer so she would probably win dontcha think? yeah... but still we'd have visitors!!!! Cuz I know that that works cuz i went to a website after seeing an ad in a magazine! In fact it was that www.beinggirl.com place I was talking about cuz it said "Are you more likely to get eaten by a skark when YA KNOW?" lol and I REALLY wanted to know the answer so I went there and guess what I found out??? The answer is YES!!!! scaaaaaaaary lol ladeda hmmmmmmm that was interesting. Today we signed up for classes for 10th grade. How exciting huh? yeah except Tiff got to be in the class I really wanted to be in- Computer Graphics- GAR I have to wait until like 11th or 12th grade when I have room to take it. argh luuuuucky! That's what I want to do- computer graphics. WOOHOO fun designing movies and signs and ads and stuff. That would be cool and I would buy all the movies that I designed and I would know HOW I did it bwahahaahahahaahh lol my fingers are cold from sitting in my oh so cold basement. YUM we got some Mt. Dew to drink tonight yum yum yum yum yum but of course we would buy it! heeheh but of course is fun. but of course! but of course! Iwanna get my permit. Me and Tiff and another friend were supposed to get them in the summer but ya know we sort of procrastinated about it forever and like E months later we STILL don't have tem. But ya know I think we're gonna get them in the spring. WE THINK. Have faith in us geez. heh actually I dunno if we'll REALLY do it either. Maybe Tiff will and then she could just bring me even if I really didn't study and then I could just mesmorize all the answers for the secind time. thats' what I heard everyone else does. yuuuuuuuuupperoo WOWZERS! ZOINKS! JINKYS! hehehehehe funness! :D XD :D XD :D XD :D XD follow the yellow brick road.. I wonder where Tiff is anyways.. she said she was getting on- maybe she IS on and we're doing stuff to the website at the SAME EXACT time again woooooooah creeepy lol I like stuff like that- like stuff that happens in Final Destination or weird coincidences and mysteries no one can explain that send a CHILL down your spine! AWESOME! Or telepathic people! Sometimes I'M telepathic! yup I got that power too! One time Ipredicted that Tiff was gonna say EGGROLLS! yeah there was other stuff too.. just cant remember. lol I forget stuff really easily. REALLY easily. lol hmmmmmmm ok welp I didn't really type much but uh yeeeeeeah ok wait I got a cool idea from Star Glazer to do a WORD OF THE DAY!!!!

I kinda have to go pee but I'll hold it for a little bit. I'm going to have to type a lot today ya see cuz we have like 59K and I want to type enough that I get to 70 because I DO NOT want to have to stop in the E's lol. EEEEVVVVIIILLL. Okay now I'm going to go pee. Alright I feel better, had to run all the way downstairs because my brother is stinking up the upstairs one..ee oh crap he just left nasty yuck that took WAAAY too long. This is going to be pretty difficult..gotta type A LOT. Sorry to flaming-chickens about the infinite stuff because she had that on her lte but I really found it very interesting..I like it lol. So lately I've been talking about it with people like seeing what they think and stuff, it's interesting. FUN! Crapper doo! I don't have much rambling done yet today...need to be working on it. Well okay then hum this is HARD lol because my life..so dull so very very dull. Tomorrow I'm going to church with Al then we're going to the mall to look for stuff for Gala..except the little problem that I don't have any money lol. So we're really going to just LOOK..probably at least, really don't think that I'll BUY anything hah oh well..nothing I really need anyway-I hate dressing up ewwwwie ew ew I hate it. I'm mad they're having gala in the cafeteria at our school..thats retarded because we have to pay 12 bucks to get in to the cafeteria?? wth...lol ar. Still gonna buy the ticketes..I'm paying for Josh MWAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA it's funny..hehe. He left his little money clip thingy with the dog on it here (yeah ya did..just so ya know) there it is sitting there, isn't that nice lol. Money Clip..thats weird..why not just put it in your wallet? I mean the dog is pretty cool but still...I guess if you don't have a wallet it would come in handy, keeps your money all organized and stuff. Well hmm idk where this came from but yeah I think I'm probably gonna be moving sometime over the summer like August probably and at my new house I get to have the basement to myself except my dads computer room. I guess my bedroom is gonna be downstairs but we have to BUILD it so for the first couple weeks I'll have to sleep with no walls..which I hate a lot lot lot because it's hard to sleep in a big room where people could..come..lol. My dad plays his computer a lot too which will suck because he plays it really loud...rar. Well though still cool because were gonna have like a guest thing downstairs where people who come from out of town can go and it will have a tv and couch and bed I think idk I think so (bed), I think it will be cool because when no one is in town lol which is most of the time..like all of the time..then I can get the whole thing to myself like a little apartment..HAH AWESOME! I hope it works out though cuz that would be cool..but yeah my dad always says we're gonna move then backs out then again and backs out again again again over and over he always does it but this time he's pretty sure because my mom is going to graduate in a few months so we'll have enough money and they really like the house. My mom is in college by the way to become an RN (nurse) right now she's one of the lower nurse thingies lol but yeah so yeah. I HOPE IT WORKS YAAAY awesome my own little living quarters wooop wooop. I'm excited!! hehehehe lol watch it won't work out now hah, best not get too happy cuz then yeah it won't work..just my luck. I SHOULD have really good luck because I'm IRISH :D :D :D hehehehe -which yeah I can't complain because I do get good luck a lot of the time. Oh yeah I'm a lot Irish and a lot German...thats pretty much what it is theres other things but like just little teeny bits of it like 32nds lol which yeah doesn't really count that much because thats barely anything. Oh my gosh gosh gosh I felt like I talked forever and it was only 3K's lol. Thats said I was thinking at least 5! cheezer louiser. I need something to eat I'm really hungry. I'm listening to Def Leppard..I like it..cool. Thinking about being Irish and then St.Patricks Day and my party lol ...gotta have it...EVERYONE'S COUNTING ON ME!! AHHH SOO MUCH PRESSURE! lol. Okay I really am really hungry..I haven't eaten like anything all day it's 5:59 (no seriously..it is not just doing it because of E..EEEK) but yeah what should I eat? I think I'm gonna have ramen noodles..HEY! they're good! and only $1.37 at Wal*Mart!!! doo doo! cool cept Wal Mart is too far for me to walk. Over by Al's house, which if I move I'll be able to walk to Wal*Mart, right now I really don't wanna because of the brr cold of the winter..brr tomorrow is February! month of looooove lol I guess since it has Valentines Day in it. Valentines are always so sad, you just watch all the happy couples being..happy...bleh then ya think whoa..I'm a loser..(LOSER PRIDE!! LOL). I need a new hairbrush..have you ever had a hairbrush where little gray lint things grow on the bristles?? well yeah mine is like that probably because I don't pull the hairs out enough and just let them sit til they coil around the bristle thingies well not bristles but they're pokey things ..w/e you wanna call them. Then it is all gray and linty and people come over and see it and they say "ewww gross! what happened to your hairbrush?!?" hehe then I laugh MWAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHHAHA nasty isn't it?? HEH HEH... Okay my stomach's growling so I'm gonna go start boiling my water...doo dee doo. Okay I got up to 5K..hah the here I go again on my own song is playing again.. I like that song. oo Yeah that reminds me I sent a survey out (don't worry Huong I didn't send it to you lol) COOL! maybe I'll get a fun little email to read. I also sent Josh an email about his LTE so maybe he'll maybe answer me...(PLEEEASE I'M DESPERATE!!!) hmm and okay yeah thats all but still. I'M AWAITING YOUR REPLIES!!!! lol okay now for serious I'm going to go boil some water. I got some bread..hehe. I eat a lot of bread. Just plain. It's good like that. Oh yeah I want to report on the status of my canker sore..lol it's STILL VISIBLE but doesn't hurt very much, it is going away YAY! it only hurts when I like pour salt on it lol. My cans are starting to collect all on my desk. My shelf is full and now becoming unrecognizable. OH how sad, I have but only 1 pack of yummy beef flavored ramen noodles left...boohoo. The reason I eat ramen noodles actually is so I can use chopsticks. I love chopsticks..they're FUN! It makes eating your food into a game..I like it..I really enjoy it, a lot, so when I go to my friends houses and they have oriental food and they give me a fork cuz they don't think I can use chopsticks..it's a real let down. Cuz I look forward to getting to use the chopsticks..I really do..it's AWESOME you all should try it if you haven't..woooohoooo okay beeep beeeep beeeeeeeeeep..I'm coming I'm coming sheesh. Ramen noodles fill ya up for about an hour but then after that you're hungry again. hah always happens to me except usually I don't get full I'm just always hungry. Always eating..yum yum yum. Okay I'm gonna eat them now I'll come back and ramble on later, when I'm done..hehe. Okay I'm done..dee dee. WTH is with the sound effects anyway? huh..I'm weird sorry lol. ^^Monday he woke up and hated life, drank until Wednesday and left his wife. Thursday through Saturday lost everything, woke up on Sunday miserable again.^^ My toe is bleeding..cool lol. Yeah I used to think it would be awesome to be a surgeon but naw I decided no because thats too many years of college! AYE! Don't want to go that long, and I'm not smart enough lol. Holly toledo my room is a disaster argh..I'll have spring cleaning this year I guess..yeah..thats it..lol SURE I WILL. Just like I'm going to get my permit in spring..heh..NO REALLY I'm going to, you don't believe me, do you? errr well I'll prove you wrong! ^^Educated, with money, he's well dressed, not funny. And not much to say in most conversations, but he'll foot the bill in all situations cuz he pays for everythiiiing. Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money. Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny. Paper or plastic, don't matter, she'll have it. Vacations, and shopping sprees these are a few of her favorite things. She'll get what she wants if she's willing to please, his type of girl always comes with a fee, hey now theres nothing for free.^^ I wonder..is there anything for free? I don't know..in a roundabout sense nothing is for free right? lol wth I alsways go on these weird things lol I'm weird okay man I'll stop. ^^The girls with the bodies like boys with ferraris.^^ haah thats funny. Ya know what that bugs me, people who are really materialistic..I think it's stupid. Clothes and stuff is stupid lol. You don't NEED THAT STUFF! and being popular would SUCK...seriously dude..it would. I've listened to those girls talking about guys and all their friends behind their backs. Wth yeah everyone probably does that but they ALWAYS have something bad to say...and why does it matter what other people are wearing? come on be a little mature lol. HAH thats funny I say that because it's those kind of people who call me and my friends immature-which we act immature a lot yeah but actually I think we really aren't as immature as some of those people, we may act like that but it's for FUUUUN.. lol Yeah sorry just thought I'd go on a little shpeel about that maturity and materialisticism and stuff ya know lol. ^^Can you feel the cold tonight? It sets in, but it's alright. Darkness falls..I'm letting go. All alone but I feel fine.^^ MAN MAN MAN I hope that we have a snow day tomorrow..PLEEEASE PLEEEASE PLEEEEASE PLEEEEASE! lol I HATE school and going one extra day in summer won't kill me. Actually I'd really like year long school because instead of going a HUGE chunk of the year then getting a little chunk off, you get it evened out-so you can go 3 weeks get 1 week 2 weeks off idk how it goes something like that though..I'd like it. If theres still year round school then I'd like to start earlier in the year like once August comes go to school lol. By the time August rolls around every year I always want to go back to school because I'm always soooo very very bored of summer..nothing left to do, I've done it all! So I want to go to school again (sad isn't it) yeah it is. Then in May I'm dying to GET OUT of school! ^^It's been a long hard road without you by my side, why weren't you there on the nights that we cried? You broke my mother's heart, you broke your children for life..it's not okay, but we're alright. I remember the days you were a hero in my eyes..but those are just a long lost memory of mine. Now I'm writing just to let you know I'm still alive, yeah I'm still alive.^^ HAHA I keep singing Good Charlotte..thats who I'm listening to..GO FIGURE.. but yeah I liked some of there songs actually -no new stuff though that I know of. I don't know how I'd know though ..don't really watch tv..or listen to the radio..ever lol. Hum thinking about when I get old and have kids..lol. I want like 2 kids but I really kinda want a boy. I don't know why, I just do. Either would be okay but I kinda want a boy..lol I'm weird..people always talk about how boys being little terrors lol. A girl would be nice but yeah I never really like the girly stuff-I was always weird, people used to make fun of me..boohoo..lol. For wearing boy clothes and not playing with dolls. My cousins made fun of me a lot lol. Oh well SKIP YOU GUYS! lol. ^^Some friends become enemies, some friends become your family. Make the best with what you're given, this ain't dying, this is living. We're moving on, and we ain't got nothing to prove..to anyone..we'll get through.^^ Alright I'll stop really lol. Duuuuuuuuuuuuder I wanna put 1 more K so I can have 72! 72 is my lucky lucky number! lucky..reminds me of Shamrock McShelby!! elevator fixer! hah from D.I. hehe. I was in D.I. in 7th grade so was Al and she was a clown and I was an elevator fixer awesome eh? yeah lol except the fact that everyone hated it..I sort of enjoyed it. A bunch of our other friends were in it too yep! Huong and I having a spot of tea in the elevator lol. That's my favorite memory from it all. We ended up doing the whole thing wrong though-can't blame it on ME because I never even got to read the DIRECTIONS! rar! geez. ^^I'm happy, feeling glad, I've got sunshine..in a bag. I'm useless, but not for long. The future is coming on it's coming on it's coming on.^^ Me and Al are going to have a fish tank wall in our college apartment. We went to this spanish club party thing to these peoples house and they had a fishtank built into a wall and we thought it was cool so we're gonna make an entire wall out of a fishtank COOL HUH! except easily broken..uhoh oh well lol yeah with us there it probably will break (especially Al)..HEHEHEH JK cho well ..sorta..lol. Those people were rich they had a lake with a swan, a golf course, planes and a home for their mobile home..lol. YaY! I'm at 72K! I feel in a singy mood today. doo doo..grease hah. ^^You better shape up! cuz I neeed a man and my heart is set on you. You better shape up, you better understand to my heart I must be true. You're the one that I want woo oo oo honey. The one that I want ooo oo oo the one I need oh yes indeeed. If you're filled with affection, your to shy to convey..meditate in my direction, feeeel your way.^^ I don't even know if those lyrics are close to right lol..hah OH WELL barely anyone comes here anyway lol and after all that typing I doubt anyone made it down this far lol. I sorta like grease..hah..weird huh? Now hug your bobble head dog and tell him you love him! Does that ball..bounce?? OOO LET ME SEE LET ME SEE!! BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE!! Tigger..hehehe, do I bounce when I walk? maybe I'm just feeling very joyous sometimes so I bounce..maybe thats all. bouncy bouncy bouncy ^^Another turning point a fork stuck in the road, time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test and don't ask why. It's not a question but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right...I hope you had the time of your life.^^ Well if you did make it this far.. I'm going to leave (finally..I know) buuuubye! ^^For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.^^ 2*2*02 *TIFF* TODAY IS A HAPPY HAPPY DAY! SNOOOOOW DAAAY! School is CANCELLED!!

If I have a kid- I'm tinking I might adopt (cuz ya know AHHH scary) I'm gonna name him/her Tipo!!!! That's an awesome name for a guy or a girl!!! lol it means DUDE in spanish. OOOOOO DI haha i was a stupid clown hahahah i wrote the script and people added to it- i don't think Ishould go into script writing or anything- it was a pretty weird play- all about a lawyer who goes into an elevator and there's a clown in there and the elevator gets stuck so the lwyer has to learn to put up with him like all night and in the morning the lawyer's gone completely insane and changed in to a clown himself. But we had to do this thing where they give us some random object and we have to incorporate it into the play 20 different times and we didn't do too great on that and w eforgot to do background changes and we didn't do our wood sculpture right at all- the wood was like 100 times too big lol so yeah it was all messed up. We actually DID buy the right wood atfirst but then people thought it was wrong and blah blahb lah but one time we were tasting the blasa wood (the right wood) to see how soft it was or what it tasted like. we were like eating it. a lot. it was sort of good. I didn't remeber that until Huong emailed us and told us about it. lol but yeah we sort of dropped out of the state compettion. i really want some KFC and Mt. Dew........oh yea hthe other day (the SNOW DAY) i went to Wal- Mart and bought some awesome Valentines!

And I think there are aliens out there somewhere. MWHAHAHAHHAHAHAH i just thought of something.. it's funny- you'll probably find out about it sooner or later cuz it's just totally great!!! tiff will tell ya proabbly next week- I just can't tell ya now cuz ya know I can't. Man show choir try outs are tomorrow-I gotta practice my song still. i'm only gonna be in it if I make it into the higher show choir though- connection. Cuz it's worth summer school i guess... we're getting cool t shirts for my current show choir (Harmonics) they're like black with gold lettering and they have some sort of picture or something on them and they say our nicknames on the sleeve. I'm just putting Al on there- couldn't think of anything else. hah I just noticed you guys don't even know my real name!!! Awesome i'm just Al to ya'll- I mean it's sort of easy to figure out Tiff's real name but mine could be anything!!! this is cool so mysterious!!!! i wonder how much I wrote? Aww only 4K. it felt like more than that. suckolla. we had these stupid ITED's today- like ITBS and I didn't know what any of the vocabulary meant- I mean how are we supposed to know some weird words??? geez and plus they like go onto our permanent records and help choose classes for us cuz of that stupid No Child Left Behind Act- grrrr Bush makes me mad. I'm a DEMOCRAT!!! And very proud of it!!! I want John Kerry to win!! That would be cool- but any of the Democrats winning over Bush would be good. *cross your fingers* lol I sound like Tiff. Mt. Dew...... I got this awesome Zobmondo book and it has great stories in it. I'm gonna get it. Ok a man from Maine heads down to florida for a weekend trip; his wife is coming to meet him the next day. he gets to his room, sets up his laptop computer, nd sens her a short email to let her know he has arrived. Unfortunately, he makes a typo in the address and his note is sent to the elderly wife of a minister who just died. When the grieving widow checks her email later that day, she lets out a scream and falls to the floor. Her children come rushing in to find the following on her screen. Dearest Wife, I have just arrived. Everything is prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Can't wait to see you. your loving Husband. P.S. It sure is hot down here! LOL funny ok here's another one- On the first day of school the first grade teacher announced to her class that they should put the baby talk of kindergarten behind them and start using grown-up words. She then asked them to tell her what they did over the summer. The first little one said he went to see his nana. The teacher said, "No, no, you went to see your grandmother. That's the grown-up word." The next little one said she went for a trip on the choo-choo. The teacher again said "No, no you took a trip on the train. That's the grwon up word." Then the teacher asked the third little one what he did during the summer. He proudly said that he'd read a book. The teacher asked what book he had read. He puffed out his chest and in a very adult way replied " Winnie the Sh#t." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAH i love that one. i got more but geez they take a long time to copy. Ok here's a blonde joke. A breasttroke race was being held from Santa Monica to Cataline for femal swimmers, and a brunette, a redhead, and a blonde were the competitors. After about 14 hours, the brunette staggered up onto shore and was declared the fastest breastroker. About 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled in for second place. Nearly 4 hours after tha, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers. When the reporters asked why it took so long for her to complete the race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like a sore loser but I think that those other girls were using their arms." heheheheeh ok I better go I'll be back tomorrow. i promise. 2*4*04 *Tiff* HEY! WELP..I just made a quiz and sent it out to everyone gonna see what everybody gets on it. I have a feeling that people might not do as well on this one even though the questions are pretty simple. Hmm I got 100% on Tina's heheheheh WOOHOO! okay I don't really feel like writing on here maybe I will later lol I know I know that was so extremely short just I'm in the middle of a conversation and I don't FEEL LIKE IT! lol good for you readers out there (all 2 of you well maybe 3..MAYBE) OKAY! Still have homework to do. Okay today was funny because for Texas Roadhouse (where we're going for homecoming) yeah everybody keeps asking to come with us...An wanted to come but today found out nvm she doesn't. Stacie wants to go with her date now and yeah Al's making sure it's okay with everyone, doesn't matter to me. Welp yeah lol it will be funny HEHE. I'm 'discussing' with Josh about Heaven and Hell. Any Christian believers out there who would email me and please tell me how is it fair or just that people who do good things and are good people all around just aren't saved go to hell and people who can do tons of bad things but just ask to be saved are saved and get to go to heaven so easily? I don't think it's fair because I mean some people are just introduced to it when they are little so they learn it their whole life then are saved, even if they are bad people who do mean things and sin they only have to ask for forgiveness and get away with it? I don't know that much about this subject just trying to learn so anyone who knows tell me please. Don't get offended by anything I say, I just don't understand it all. People who aren't brought up that way, and are brought up to believe something else are just sent to hell because they never ask to be saved? They were taught to believe something by their parents, and they trust their parents (there's even a thing about supposed to honor thy mother and father right?) okay so they do and they trust them so they are sent to hell? Alright just wanted to babble about that I know a lot of people don't even believe in it sorry lol but yeah it's MY LTE (and Al's of course) so I can type whatever I want to! I don't like that people who are nice and do good things end up in hell when complete jerks end up in heaven. Not saying that everyone in hell is good and everyone in heaven is bad no no no no no NOOOO don't believe that at all, so don't get me wrong. Not saying Christians are jerks woo I really am not just making a point (trying). SOMEONE help me I don't get it at all I'm uneducated lol. 2*4*04 *AL* I know I promised I'd write today so I couldn't break my promise but I don't got time to write much cuz I gotta study for a science test I forgot about. AHHH science scary!!!!!! science is evil. adios duders! 2*5*04 *Tiff*!!! HEEEEYAA!!! How is everyone TODAY? thats great! (I think) ^^Your love is like a roller coaster baby baby, I wanna ride. Your love is like a roller coaster baby baby, I wanna ride. Move over there cuz I'm a double dipper. Upside Down on the dip dip dipper. One, Two, One Two Three, oh I've got a ticket so ride with ME. Merry go down on the Merry go round, all is fair on a big fair-ground. Lets go slow, lets go fast, lickery split gonna whip your WOO WOO WOO WOO!^^ Hah I like that song it's awesome. Okay gonna go to the mall quick (I think) for stuff for gala ...yep last minute ooofff coouuurrssee. hehehhe. SOO anyway I read Josh's LTE the ending part it's pretty confusing but I liked the part about people always having to destroy everything..we do. It reminds me of the saying 'rules were made to be broken'. Which is party true I guess. Rules were made to be obided by but the consequences were made for when you break the rule...eh w/e idk what I'm talking about g2g p then leave but yeah I'll probably come back later and type actually I'm pretty positive that I will so I guess I'll be..yeah back later. Gonna leave my away message up the entire time hehehe...it's a cool song too. ^^Who said that I wasn't right? I've lived for years without a life. Don't have a soul on my side. Still ridiculed despite how hard that I have tried. Don't take me under your wing. I don't need a hand, don't need anything. I've got a roof over my head, as if I'd rather be alone with me instead.^^ Doo Doo Doo woooooosh! AWESOME! It's 7:11 COOOOL, Al's favorite time lol. ^^Hit the road Jack, and don'tcha come back no more, no more, no more, no more, hit the road Jack and don'tcha come back no more!^^ BUFFALO! I'll swashbuckle any land lubber me sees ye scurvy dogs!! WELL WELL WELL what do we have here...looks like a trio of TRESPASSERS! and quite by accident let me assure you..a simple navigational error. OH-oh-oh wait wait, you're Mufasa's little STOOGE. I madam am the Kings ____ dodo! and that would make you. Future King! and do you know what we do to Kings who step out of there Kingdom??? .....WHO YOU CALLIN UPIDSTE?!! I feel bad..I brought Douglas home and I'm not even going to write in him. Drives me crazy when people do that they just keep it..don't write in it. DO THEY KNOW HOW EXCITED I GET TO HAVE THE NOTEBOOK???!?!?!? why!? very excited yes indeedy doo. lol. hum I'm going to look for a new icon I've had the same one forever, geez. Today in 4th per. English I was singing home on the range, I always do that, always tell Bailey to draw buffalo because she always shows her drawings..she's good. She won't draw buffalo though..geez not one measly little BUFFALO? come on..DRAW A BUFFALO!!!! she knows she wants to just in denial. DENIAL DENIAL DENIAL! like Josh, says he can't bowl but really he can he just wanted to trick us..evvvvviiiill!!! lol CoOL I saw one (buddy icon) sugar rush neeeato cheetos! think I'll take it! cooooolio. ARGH! not working not working Commooon oh well (all well) hehe I might be back later chos adiadi buuuuuubye! 2*6*04 *AL* Coolio tomorrow is Gala and we're going GLOBOWLING!!!! Awesome I can't wait- I love to bowl- but yeah Josh he lies ooo big time cuz he said he averages 50 in bowling and he was getting over 100 cuz he doesnt hold the little hole thingers he just throws it but we both know he's lying he just didnt want to seem like this awesome bowler or anything so if you ever happen to see him just say DENIAL DENIAL DENIAL heh i love to say that. anyways babysitting tonight. lalala I don't really have anythign to say- this LTE is dwindling away.... ummmm oh yeah I found out for sure now that it WAS Phi who hacked my last LTE and ruined it. EVIL PHI!!!! I gotta get more quizzes for my website. *TIFF* HAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAHAH! no no no the LTE MUST NOT DWINDLE AHHHH!!!! just that it's a slow time because all that we are talking about is gala. Gala, gala, gala, gala blah blah gala gala lol, umm yeah cuz that is the only interesting thing going on in my life and yeah so thats all I talk about lalala. Well hm yeah so yeah lol she SAID EVERYTHING! thats all thats going on in my head but yeah ya know I'll write lots after gala talking about how it goes and stuff. I need something DRAMATIC to happen so that Ngoc can get her story lol. She wants to know if something dramatic has every happend in my life and well nothing I really want to have her write a paper on lol..it's a little bit personal ya know? but yeah oh well this would be a good paper. It is a phase biography so has to be on someone else. I'm writing a phase autobiography --and yeah since my life is so extremely boring I have nothing to write about, but Melissa came up with this idea to write about WAFFLES. Ok WHAT IS WAFFLES YOU ASK? no, NOT the breakfast food. Waffles is the Williams Association For a Free Lunch Environment...socks. lalala. lol. OKAY what it was was a revolution against the system last year in 8th grade at Williams Intermediate. It was made up by me and Kehlie to change the system! Ya see in 8th grade 1st semester at lunch we could sit WHEREVER we want, with our friends and everything BUT 2nd semester they CHANGED IT!!!! *gasps!* They made us sit with our CLASSES ..eww...lol. Well we made up ideas to get back at them and TRY to make them change it back. We wrote this threatening letter and glued ham to it...under the ham I wrote "jiggle jiggle change lunch back or this will be YOU..FOOLS!" well not that exactly except the jiggle jiggle part. Kehlie and I got quite a chuckle thinking of our associate principal at the time lol JIGGLE JIGGLE, she did the pop after lunch when they did The Casper Slide and it was quite disturbing lol. ANYWAY~ another idea of mine was to stick pizza and french fries down the toliets til they were clogged - mostly just cuz I thought it would be fun but ALSO to DISTRACT the opposition. Mwahahahhaahhahahahhaha! okay soooo. Well it never worked but I'm remain a PROUD WAFFLE! (I wrote that at the end of my paper..because..I AM a proud waffle!) hehe, yeah that was fun...wonder if I have to read it to the entire class. hehe. Nobody is online to talk to. argh. and no one ever leaves tag-board messages on MY site..it's sad..really sad...I'm soo looooneely!! HAHA Huong ^^When I was young, I never needed anyone. Making love was just for fun...those days are gone. Living alone, I think of all the friends I've known, but when I dial the telephone...nobody's home. All by myself, don't wanna be all by myself..anymore. Hard to be sure, sometimes I feel so insecure and love so distant and obscure, remains the cure. All by myself, don't wanna be all by myself..anymore.^^ I kinda like it okay so just yeah I know you guys all think I'm stupid (yes all of the millions of readers out there!) lol but I don't care. BOOYAW! lol. ^^All things considered I'm doing just fine, even though ya left a hole the size of Texas deep inside, and my heart the way I'm feeling should be losing my mind but all things considered..dun dun, I'm doing just fine!^^ I still have a butterfingers on my desk from Christmas. I offered Josh the butterfingers but NOOOO he doesn't want it. He should want it. His e-mail says butterfingers in it so WHY WHY WHY doesn't he want the butterfingers? WHY? I don't get it. It still has the wrapper and everything..mint condition..not like I peed on it or anything. It's not contaminated or poisoned..it's a little old but I mean what is the butterfingers expiration date? a long time isn't it? yeah probably let me check. Okay it doesn't tell me but it's probably still a long time away ya know? right? HAH me and Al's sacred special mt.dew expired on June 7th. June 7th we gotta get together and savor it hopefully it will still be good it says til June 7th so it BETTER BE! Ya gotta have the willpower man! Yeah then after we drink it we got to go get another one HEHE to be the *ALL NEW* sacred Mt.Dew. 2*7*04 Tiff here, 11:34 ahh thats creepy!!! wths lol okay nvm anyway..wow thats weird wth. YEAH well it's the day of gala. Gala sounds stupid why can't they call it Sadie-Hawkins anyway? thats what it is...oh well. Just finished my 1st mt.dew of the day. Josh wants to come over early so he should be here in like 2 or 3 hours I guess. Thinks he's gonna do my hair AHHHHHHH thats really scary but I don't think I'll let him. lol. Welp I got time to kill now. This always happens before some exciting event. The day of the thingy you just sit around and do nothing before it starts -there isn't anything to do! I can't get dressed yet I'll end up getting the dress icky before I go out and eat (where I'll double the messiness) and I don't want to wear panythose and heels for 12 hours so no. ^^Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own. Tell me that it's better when you're all alone. Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch. Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much. Tell me you ain't dying when you're crying for me. Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice, Cause i don't wanna burn in Paradise Oh, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go...^^ Aerosmith awesome. Yeah I'm always bored before I go somewhere and I'm bored now-don't you hate it? all full of anticipation and not being able to do anything just makes it worsez! rar! My fingernail polish looks really creepy..lol COOOL heheh. Well I'll tell ya how it goes....doodoo! 2*8*04 *AL* well heeeelllllooo there everyone yup we're back from Gala- it was fun! Especially the Glow Bowling part!!!!!!! i love to bowl AND Tiff looked all tan under the black light so that was really cool too- but uh ok here's how it went--- we went to Texas Roadhouse Grill to eat and we all ordered (ALL is me, Tiff, Josh and Rusty) chicken critters and mashed potatoes and baked beans except Rusty had a salad. Yeah so anyways we're talking we're talking and ya know Rusty has to go to the bathroom so while he's there we tell the waitress that it's his birthday ( ya know it's really not until August 14 but what the heck) so the whole rest of the time we just laughed at our clever selves but I don't think the waitress believed Josh cuz nobody ever came out with the horse to sing to him. So then we left to go to the actual DANCE. So we get there and we get in and then we get pictures and then we dance but a lot of the songs were like slow boring ones-so sorta blah ya know but then they had some fast fun ones like at a dance club which sound like fun and we were swing dancing and square dancing type dancing yup- cuz me and Tiff requested COTTON EYED JOE!!!! That song rocks!! ^^(cool) if it hadn't been for Cotton Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago! Where'd ya come from, where'd ya go, where'd ya come from Cotton Eyed Joe???^^ AWESOME!!! So yeah we danced our socks off and rocked our socks until it was time to announce the Gala King and Tony Johnson was SUPPOSED to win cuz he puts the "T" in "cool" but there was some kind of mistake and some other guy won. SO I DEMAND A RECOUNT!!! lol so then we left the dance sort of early cuz it wasn't all that great and we went and changed out of our dresses(HALLELUJAH!) and went GLOW BOWLING!!!!!! We got awesome shoes with glow in the dark shoelaces but me and Tiff had to trade one cuz one pair didn't have glow in the dark shoes and she needed some too right?? But I kept getting gutter balls- I think I came in third the first two games and wee were really craving some Mt. Dew too but there wasn't ANY so that was sad but we ended up getting some later. Then we had a tournament between the guys and the girls and me and Tiff won totally!!!!! :D :D :D :D yeah so that was the night and everyone was really hyper that night too- like we couldnt stop laughing and Josh couldnt stop screaming. lol But ALL IN ALL it was pretty darn fun. i think we're gonna go Glow bowling on a regular basis. This weekend there's a party gonna be going on at Tiff's house. IT'S GONNA BE SOOOOOO MUCH FUUUUUN!!! I can't wait! :D XD! yeah I'm gonna be all excited all week. But I can't say aything about it right now. You'll find out later. heheeheehehheeh But for all you people who aren't in high school- I would RECCOMEND not going to Gala and Prom and stuff unless you're like going with a guy- cuz they play a lot of slow songs and stuff which aren't very fun- especially Gala cuz it's a like a Valentine's Day Dance and all. But Homecoming is REALLY fun. Lots of good songs and stuff. But that's just my school. Maybe yours is different. Idk. I'm very immature. MWAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAAHAHHAH heheheheeh anyways i gotta go look up lyrics for Cotton Eyed Joe. ^^What's the D-D-D-Dilio Dilio What's the D-D-D-Dil? what's the D-D-D-Dilio, Dilio? What's the D-D-D-Dil?^^ That song is cool but that's the only part I know. heh *TIFF* THE DILLIO SONG IS AWEEEEESOOOOMMMEEE!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah so yeah gala was fun actually gala was kinda stupid EXCEPT for like a couple of songs (COTTON EYE JOE!) otherwise yeah DUUULLL lol. Glow Bowling was the BEESSSTT! AHH MY GOSH lol it was awesome chos, I WAS TAN!!! WAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOO LOL it's IMPOSSIBLE and really really..not fair, so yeah now we have to always go glow bowling because it's fun and cool and yeah it's really fun lol. ME AND AL beat Rusty and Josh SOOOOOO BAAAADDD they're embarassed so they're going around saying they one..pathetic FOOOLS! lol eee don't hurt me lol. Yeah me and Al and Josh were just cracking up at dinner when Rusty got back from the bathroom cuz Josh told the lady it was his bida. It was retarTed (retart tart tart like a poptart!) because she didn't even do anything..ar! Dude glow bowling's music was WAY better then the crap they played at the dance! eww that wasn't worth the money I paid lol ... like REALLY we shoulda just gone glow bowling because that was awesome!!! lol yeah if you can't tell I really really enjoyed it. WOOP! I love to bowl lol it's fun! haaah lol but I don't know if I'd really like to be on a team because I don't like to compete much, rather just like ya know mess around its way funner. HAH it was cool some guy came over from a different lane and was like holly toledo! did you pick up that spare!? that was the best I've seen all night GOOD JOB! then yeah he gave me a high 5 it was cool because I got this spare smack on it was awesome I felt cool for a few seconds lol MAN! then when I got a strike no one was watching they were all *chatting* lol so everyone missed it! and dude me and Al need to work on our awesome handshake! HAH! she forgot to take the **SACRED MT. DEW!** home but now we are gonna switch off ya see cuz she has this cool spongehammer that we got at youth group tonight so we're gonna switch the sacred mt.dew with the sacred sponge hammer!!! WOOOOP! cool huh? yeeeah I know lol. ^^Chickity China the Chinese chicken You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'!^^ hah I thought it was starts clickin' oh well lol either works. 2*9*04 *AL* haaaaalllllloooo party party prty on Friday night- yeah we're gonna play superheroes- I want flying, invisibility, laser eyes, trasportation, and lightning strikes! AWESOME! I wish I had a blue boot!!!! I wish I had ze hammer!!!! Awesome my Windows Media Player actually found Cotton eyed Joe. I'm gonna put it on a CD over and over and over!!!!!!!2*10*04 HEY! okay I got like 7 minutes to type and I'm going to try to get a little bit added. It's been hard to add to the LTE for Al because she's busy a lot always gone and me? no excuse..just don't know what to type. SOOOO instead of typing on here I just sit at home and whine about how incredibly dull and boring my life is when really it doesn't HAVE to be that way? Life is what you make it right? right so if I could just find something to beleive in and something to do then I would always have something to think about and always have something to do and yeah I wouldn't have to sit at home and mope. wah wah wah my life is so boring. wah wah wah. When really there are people who are never bored, there's always something interesting to do. I'm thinking about doing soccer this year at West but I'm not sure if I will or not. I kinda just want a hobby, something to do, SOMETHING and I feel pretty out of shape and unhealthy and I think doing soccer would help me out. Only cons is that it takes up a lot of my sit at home and do nothing time which is so very important to me :D lol. I feel happier now then I did before. herm...NERP! hah. Nothing really to add though, nothing interesting happens. I CAN'T WAIT TIL SUMMER! Ah oh my gosh I've been like saying that all the time lately but it's true! last summer was sooooo mucho fun-o lol and I want to have another mucho fun-o summer! No school! yesssss! This summer I THINK I get to move too! cool! YAY! lol I'm excited! if you can't already tell which yeah I think you can. hah. I already talked all about me getting to move. It's sorta weird writing here because I don't know who is reading it I'm just writing to the air. Hey! whoever wants to read about Tiff or Al's life you can find out here. Hmm. Makes you feel weird like very exposed (even though very few few few people even come here) hah. I wonder how much I've typed so far. I think it's actually almost been 7, oh it's been 5. Well ya know I am going to type 8 because my other clock lets me have 2 extra minutes. hehe. Well I was gonna type until 10:00 then just go to bed (nothing else to do). 2*14*04 *AL* Happity Valentines Day everyone or Feliz el dia de San valentin! Yeah I forgot how to do the accents (I lost the code sheet) Anyways just thought I should type something here cuz I haven't in a while but there's really nothing interesting going on.... we had the party for Josh last night and we gave him the special present!! It was funio! and then when we came in from playing outside in the snow, I got charlie horses in both of my legs at the same time and it hurt REALLY bad like I was gonna die. GAAAAAH soo very hurtful!!!! And we got spun upside down- sooo much fun YEAH summer that was fun lots of fun stuff but ya know we did have a great summer jumping off cliffs and stuff!!! :D I also got chased by this dude yesterday, cuz Iwas gonna walk and meet up with Josh and Tiff and this guy was coming one way and I was going the other way and I passed him and he turned around and was like HEY! so i walked over to the other side of the street and went the other way and he was gonna start chasing me but this lady saw him that was delivering stuff to people's dorrs so he got scared and ran off but ooo it was scary. lol but yeah that's my exciting life right now. lol i think I'm going to a Mallards game tomorrow hmmm don't know for sure. President's Day off!!! Awesome- I think friends and me migt be going over to Huong's. Not sure yet though. yup yup talk at cha'll later. adios 2*15*04 hey guys! ahh man I know it's been forever since I've typed on here aye aye aye I know. blah. Well I've been busy lately ya see on Thursday me and Al went to buy stuff for Josh's party which was on Friday and we also got to pick up little teeny pieces of styrofoam and put them in garbage bags! Oh and I had coffee that made me really hyper and yeah WAHHOOOOO!! when I got home it was good TONS of sugar and yeah cream and yeah it was actually good just tasted like straight sugar though. Welpers I just got home from church it's AHHH 12:34 how evil 34 but how cool because 1 2 3 4 hah awesome even though yeah 34 is evil. Josh started that 34 thing ya see it's evil because 11:34 is hell and now he always see's 34 whenever he looks at the clock even though that is only "he" but yeah still creepy because it's ALWAYS something 34. eeeeek! Yeah and I made this cool CD for Allison has cotton eye joe on it! even though it has the second verse twice but it's still cool. Has It's Tricky, pussycat song (lol), all things considered, uhh chickity china the chinese chicken, have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin! and a bunch of old songs..kung fu fighting, drift away even though it's not really that old lol, Mr.Vain, Wanna be my Lover yeah etc... can't remember. I'm eating those red hot thingies they're good mmmm but yeah not hot lol. They're in this cup that Josh gave me yesterday that we made at the firworks place. It's cool it's red and has a storm on it, black clouds and lightning and weird trees lol because I can't paint a tree and a funky lookin' cave lol. It looks like an igloo..sorta. Yeah last night I went with Josh to blackhawk state park and we went on this trail in the woods it was cool yeah but we saw this rat and he got scared so I had to carry him all the way back. It was one of Mr.Weber's rats that he collects. Didn't I tell you? Mr.Weber is a rat collecter he has those little tube thingies running all through his house..the entire house is wired. They're all attatched to the ceiling. So ya see now when HE is in the bathroom he can watch his rats go to the bathroom TOO. When he is sittin' back watching the ice skating tournaments, his rats can sit back and watch "the power of cheese" commercials. Turns out that rats aren't into ice skating. So they leave during that and come back for the commercials. Okay yeah back to my ORIGINAL story. So I was carrying Josh back to the car and we got in and yeah zoom zoom zoom and we're back at his house, then we watch this movie and I fell asleep on his couch and when I woke up he was staring at me with a freaky look I was scared lol. Right now as I write this I'm wearing his sweatpants because my jeans got all wet, they're really comfy, I think thats what made me fall asleep because the sweatpants are so darn comfy. I don't think I'm gonna give them back, I'm just gonna steal them and keep them forever MWAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAH! my sweatpants!!! MWAHAHAHAAH! naw thats not nice, I'll give them back but I got to go out and buy myself a nice pair of gray sweatpants. Oh and yeah back to Friday at the party and I skipped some stuff I got to do Saturday too, I was busy busy busy hehe NERP!. Well ya see on Friday me and Al had this party for Josh just to give him his bobble heads Ike(his alien wife), Jimmy (his alien child) and the fireman which uh idk if it has a name. WELL! yeah the party was cool we played outside and it was fun hacky sack, and we spun around in circles upside down weeee! and we made snow angels and my toe hurts and Allison got charlies horses (uh I think) in both her legs and collapsed onto my floor lol it was funny. Ok then on Saturday (I found your hacky sack Al it was behind the couch) anyway yeah everyone came over and we just sat there for a long time because no one talked at all but then we started getting into it talking discussing and yep. Well I'm not gonna really get into it. Huong wants to be a cocoa bean. lol. Alright I got to go look for Allison's book thinger but ya see I think she's wrong because I was pretty sure that she brought the book home but yeah maybe I'm wrong so I'm gonna go look. Man man no one ever leaves anything on the tag-board and Allison has had forgetful as her mood FOREVER! lol CHOSTER is gonna be on our liscense plate cool huh? yeah heheheHEH! My room is a huge mess eeeeek! idk if I'll be able to find Allison's book that is at her HOUSE! lol watch me be wrong heh great. Oh yeah at the party thing Friday we played with the balloons we put them in our shirts then sumo wrestled to see who's would pop first it was funny. For some reason Josh got really lucky and his didn't pop as easy as me and Al's. It's not fair just cuz he's taller so we can't get the full affect on his balloon ya know. That's when I hurt my toe it bent like funky yeah all they way I was standing on top of my toe that was smooshed under my foot yeah it just hurt okay still hurts. I keep getting hurt lately. I hate the word cream. Dictionary.com does exist! and vacuum cleaners are evil I have 2 scars both caused by evil vacuum cleaners, vacuuming is the worst chore in the world...well idk about cleaning the toliet or vacuuming okay hard choice herm I'll have to think about that one...2*18*04 *Tiff* ey! I know I know eeeeek I never type on here anymore aye! told you though my life is so dull and nothing happens and just gosh actually I don't think my life is that dull..to be honest with ya, I think it's pretty interesting and I like it but yea other people would praobably say that my life is boring but yeah thats them soo BLAH I don't care! lol Al said she was gonna type on here and she uh never got on lol. Must have been busy or yeah something. I think I'm gonna get a Mt.Dew. Waaaaaaaah! this is sad while I was gone everyone drank all of the mt.dew this is really sad gosh people come on be a little considerate. Got water instead. My tastebuds are all owwie from eating red hots tons and tons of red hots and hot tamales I've been living on them lately oOoOoOo so good. The water is really cold kinda hurts me teeth owwie lol I don't like my teeth can't bite into ice cream either ow hurts brain freeze eeek! sad so sad. So I had this creepy dream last night with yeah Josh he got in a car accident and so he had to go to jail,lol hey things don't always make sense in dreams. Yeah so he was in jail and he got beat up by this huge guy it was weird it was like this really tall huge fat guy who punched him and he went down with only one punch and then the fat guy jumped on him and punched some more. But he lived! lol. Okay then erm yeah I was at 5 points and I was looking for Josh in the prison (taking my time though hahahahahahaha!) yeah and I went on the little stairs but couldn't go over them they kept going up and up and up and wouldn't stop! ahh neverending stairs. The sky was red too like bright red and everything kinda reflected off of it so it looked all bloody everywhere. Yeah then I woke up. I woke up a few times during the dream too mostly during the beat up part so when I went back to sleep it just repeated Josh getting beat up only like yeah 3 times though lol. HAH! lol yeah but I was pretty freaked out it was a scary dream. Red sky and neverending stairs and having to save Josh from jail. It's supposed to rain!!! YAY! like at the end of this week I guess like yeah Thursday (my favorite day :D) lol or Friday yeah. hehehehe! I'm excited it hasn't rained in a long time and I love the rain, so much I love the rain. It's cool it's like you can go out and walk in the rain and you feel relieved? everyone is going to think I'm a big retard for saying this lol but ok it is therapeutic, it lets the sadness out. Watching rain helps relieve sorrow lol. The rain is like teardrops that let all of the sadness out so then when the rain stops you feel better? I like during best though. I like to be sad sometimes actually, I listen to sad songs and just be sad for fun because yeah I find it fun. It is fun. Actually not fun there's a different word fun isn't it. Rain is wonderful! If you have no sorrows you can just go out and run around in the rain and play in it it's fun. You don't even have to be IN the rain you can just sit on your fron porch thingy (this is what I do) and watch it from under the roof thingy lol. Or I go in the garage and get a little chair and just sit on it and watch the rain and write. It's cool I enjoy it a lot. 2*19*04 *Tiff* hey again guys >me Tiff, putting off hwk so yeah hello. I have nooooooodles! yum I love noodles. Noodles and milk because yeah no mt.dew yesterday evil Roberta takes them and doesn't finish them. I can't stand him grr I want outta here.

I changed my whole thingy to green like the computer layout color for St.Patricks day I'm not really a huge green person it's okay but not like my favorite color or anything its alright. I think it might get annoying and I'll end up changing it after a month of torture lol. It's not torture just different and really bright and yeah. Lots of hwk tonight. ARGH!

It's 26 letters long! 2*22*04 *AL* Hello everyone once agin- wow nobody's wrote here for about 3 days- maybe 2 idk lol but yeah I was at a show choir thing all weekend- on Friday from 7:45 in the morning to 7:30 at night and on Saturday from 6:00 in the morning to 12:00 at night- it was the longest two days I've ever had. lol but- being the good friends that they are- Tiff and Josh came to keep me company on Saturday at 2:00 so we went over to the Blackhawk Hotel to go up to the 11th floor to see what it looked like and then we went to like the 10th, 9th and maybe 8th floor too not sure, but then we rode back down to the 1st floor- oh yeah we went to the Eth floor too to see if they skipped room number EEE but there wasn't that many rooms- but anyways when we got out at the 1st floor there was a guy standing there and a lady from the hotel said she's had kids running around all day on the elevators screaming down the halls and dumping over ash trays and putting chairs on the elevators and stuff and we said it wasn't us cuz ya know it wasn't but they didn't believe us and had the PD come in and call our parents and Tiff and Josh had to go home after they'd only been there for like 30 minutes. But even Mr. Weber saw us get on the elevator too and he didn't say anything and he got on the elevator too and was riding it so we thought it would have been funny if HE was the one who was running around screaming and dumping out the ash trays and stuff and riding from floor to floor lol and then it was his evil plan for us to get caught and not him. lol yup and then today me Tiff and Josh were gonna go bowling cuz it's like our favorite thing to do so we went to our trusty Leisure Lanes but they had league bolwing all day so we couldn't bowl so we started walking not knowing where we were heading and then along came one of Josh's friends and he gave us a ride to the mall so then i got some orange chicken and Tiff got a Super Burrito (she's had one every day this weekend) cool huh? lol thenI got some Mt. Dew and then we went to Toys r us and walked around and bought some balloons which we WERE gonna play balloon sumo wressling with but then we couldn't cuz Josh ended up having to go home after we walked from Toys R Us to Bowlmor Lanes where we actually got to bowl 4 games except I don't think that we are gonna go back there cuz it pretty much sucks- all the lanes are messed up and it's really small and it's pretty much cursed cuz these two boys had shirts with the numbers E and 34 which is Tiff and Josh's evil numbers- I don't have an evil number- maybe I should get one lol. So yeah then I went back to Tiff's for like half an hour and we talked and then I came home and ate and now i'm sitting here typing lol and tomorrow is Monday so we get to go back to school- YAY not. man I cannot wait until summer- it's so much fun- but hah probably won't type on the LTE much. in summer we go exploring all the time and walk around everywhere- the creek is really fun to explore- fun times, fun memories. ahhh man I just want it to be summer even more now. The winter sucks and so does the spring mostly. In spring all it does it rain rain and get muddy and blah but Tiff likes the rain but hates Spring- lol doesn't really make sense. we have like E5 days left of school still- ahhhh too many!!!!! save us all please!!!! hm I might have already said that lol. I have a tendency to reapeat stuff- like a lot. At the show choir thing yesterday Ilearned this really annoying rhyming ting- it goes Hey (name)! Hey what? Are you ready? For what? To jig! Jig what? Jigallo! i put my hands up high and my feet down low! This is how I jigallo! S/he puts his/her hands up high and his/her feet down low. This is how s/he jigallos! jigallo! Jig Jigallo! jigallo! Jig jigallo! heheheh anyways it's pretty annoying...did you know in Me, Myself, and Irene there's a cow that doesn't die? I saw that movie a really long time ago nd I forgot about the non- dying cow. that's the funniest part though. lol shooby doopy doop welp I gotta study for tests that I missed for show choir- blah too many tess- the torture the torture!!!! lol see ya around hm actually probably not lol. 2*23*04 heya heya hello weekend didn't go well and neither did today BLAH! oh well what can I do? yep exactly. My computer is still screwed up so I'm on my dads..hah. Figures he got on mine because HIS was messed up, now his is fixed and mine is broken THANKS A LOT. So negative..sheesh. Well yeah the thing Saturday with the police was retarded. We didn't do anything and right when we got to the bottom floor there are a buncha people yelling at us, came out of no where. hah I was thinkin' what the heck are they talking about. Yeah so we had to sit there while they called our parents. Al's were there so they just took her away to them and me and Josh had to sit there FOREVER ahh! lol yeah the lady got pissed because we were laughing- we were NOT supposed to be enjoying ourselves!!! bad children naughty naughty. Yeah then Jody came and was mad and we had to write sorry cards lol. Then yeah we left BOOYAH! you stuuupid people! garrrrgaarrr!! This is really short. I have nothing to do...boooored bleh. herm I should prob change my imood I guess yeah probably. I tried to get on here Saturday but couldn't..password troubles. Man I wanna listen to music but idk where my dads music is...and I'm scared of what he will have in his music file. eeeee. OH WELL can't find it anyway just going to have to sit here bored and musicless oh what fun. Doing laundry...fun. Got to babysit tonight bleh just another crappy thing to add to my crappy day..crappy last 3 days. Well okay yeah they actually were okay woulda been pretty fun but each day seems like there was something to ruin it. Curse of the E and the 34. hahahaha Josh hasn't typed on his LTE forever. Man I want a pretty candle..I think I'll steal it mwahahahahahahhhahahahah! being evil on the LTE makes me feel better about my crappy day sorta lol. Whoa wths creepy my dad has lots of lightning photos ..I wonder if he looked through my stuff and stole those from me lol. Some of them look familiar and some don't so yeah I don't think so. Thats a weird coincidence though cuz I have lots of lightning pics on my computer because one day me and Josh were on google looking at lightning on the images thing and I saved a bunch of the cool ones. Creepy why does my dad have those..creepy. I don't HATE Spring I just don't like it that much..I love rain though thats the only good thing about spring is that it rains, and that it's closer to summer which is closer to fall. I love fall. It feels like I've been typing and typing but haven't gotten anywhere because I don't think I have 2K even maybe I do. Idk but yeah feels like forever and I have basically nothing to show for it. hehe I'm looking at the pictures on the computer...hee it's fun..:D okay gonna go do that for now adios until I get bored and come back! mwahahah! hehe 3*1*04 *Tiff* Happy March. I wrote on here yesterday but it didn't send. I'm been having lots of computer problems lately so I couldn't login to angelfire and type on here - always got messed up unless I was on my dad's computer. I want to move out of this house I hate it. Hum. What to put? Allison said that the LTE was dwindling lol HUM I WONDER WHY. lol -errr I went to internetjunk and put that I think gays are wrong lol and yeah they're going to be mad I can't wait to see what they say. Josh made me do it..he sorta persuaded me to put it. Like everyone on that site disagrees with me haaaaaaa. Funny. Don't ya think? I do herm..NERP! Isn't life funny...idk what is getting me on this subject but yeah you know a lot of people think they know people but really don't lol like okay most my friends don't know me very well at all they just *THINK* that they do-it's actually really sad when I think about it. Really sad. You don't know how little people know until there is one person who knows A LOT-thats just me actually who knows about everyone else. I don't know my friends very well either so it all evens out. If everyone was gay then humans would be extinct..eventually..wouldn't they? I have the urge to take some quizzes and put them on my website but I don't know if I'll get around to it. School is alright lately actually-even though I hate it. lol. I like social studies..I actually learn in Mr.Pagan's class. I really dislike math..have a C in there. Hate Acapella and DEFINITELY don't want to be in it next year. Don't like English Strategies because they lady doesn't teach the way I like teachers to...teach lol. She isn't clear enough she just like gives us a paper then we guess when it's due lol. She also gave me a C when I turned everything in and said the reason is because we haven't done much in class? wths? Yeah whatever thats retarded so I'm mad lol. I am not against C's or anything I just think it's stupid that I'm getting a C for no reason because I do a lot of annoying crap in that class. It's too unorganized..I don't like classes like that. Then Spanish sucks I don't know why I hate it I like spanish the actual language just the class sucks it seems like it drags on and on and we do too much work we have to think too much lol. I liked last semester better because yeah she just let us have a free period pretty much except for writing Vocab and taking tests lol. Then Science is alright I guess...nothing really extra special there its just another class..yeah..uhuh lol it's alright. So yeah just went through my schedule and whined about my stupid school life blah! I really want school to be over, I'm ready for summer vacation. I wrote on the internetjunk site about abortion too-it's weird, I used to be very very much for abortions but now I am completely against them..weeird. Now I don't even understand how someone can be for them really? I sorta do but I think that it doesn't make near as much sense as being against them. I don't know what I think..weird. My reasons aren't really religious even but they were saying on the site that they were moral reasons. I didn't think so. Just that killing is wrong but yeah okay lol is that really a moral reason? Are there people who think that there is nothing wrong with killing innocent babies? I am for the death penalty so it's not like I think killing is completely wrong -but I think it's justifiable in some situations..like Saddam lol. Well I'm not really sure haven't really talked to anyone about it before where they disagreed and I could see their views. I have a little I guess but not too much. Alright I might get on later. I love thin mint girl scout cookies <3 <3 <3 like really a lot so very much so so very much. I ate almost an entire package of them yeah like yeah just now ew just sneezed out of my mouth lol...ha! E-mail us! and tell us if you stare at your poop as it flushes down the toliet! I sure do watch poop spin in circles as it flushes down the toliet! Say it loud and say it proud! :D lol why are people embarassed? Everyone poops! Do you think that no one else in the world has ever pooped? Well they have! Everyone poops! POOP! POOP! POOP! Hallelujah! lol okay thats a good place to stop..see ya later alligators! woop! hehehheheheheh I feel hyper now..DA! hahahahaha. well basically.......HA! Okay I'm done. 3*2*04 *Tiff* heya chachis!

I just had a craving for it today cuz it seemed like everyone had gum and I'm stuck having none!!!!! yum I love Girl Scout cookies too!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D thin mints and peanut butter things and caramel delights and pinantas- those are the ones we have. Idk what the pinatas taste like cuz I haven't tasted them yet.... they got starberries on them. blah blah blah school- couldn't wait for it last summer cuz I got bored towards the end but now I can't wait for summer!!!! molecular biology is okay but Brooker is always saying "Onward class" and thinking up labs that don't work- like today we were supposed to get DNA from a banana and then say "Look it's DNA!" and then do nothing. lol idk kind of funny.. but Strunk was way cooler. Acapella and Show choir ahhh don't get me started Weber is scary and I'm quitting both next year. phew. Band- ya know just normal- okay. ummmm Geometry- boring- who needs to know how to write proofs??? are we gonna prove everything in life? why can't people just accept that it's true??? geez and Flinker... Spanish is ok- the most exicting class of the day almost besides Brooker's and his labs. American Studies- AHHHHH I HATE history! So boring.... ok well that was exciting- I'm sure you all wanted to know that... heh gays getting married- hm well it's their life and if they want to screw it up and sin big time then that's their choice and besides they're really not hurting anybody anyways. yup me too totally against abortion- Pam Stenzel "My father is a rapist. I don't even know my nationality. Do you really think that my life is worth less than yours because of how I was concieved? I didn't deserve the death penelty for some crime my father committed." yeah I totally disagree with it- the baby doesn't deserve to die- and I believe since I'm a Christian that everybody has a purpose in life- so what if the baby that was aborted was meant to be somebody special- or make a huge difference in the world? Or save somebody from an accident or dying? Now they won't be there to do all those things and more people will suffer from it than if the baby was there and lived their life. That's just what I think though. This is sad- I can't even think of my own topics to write about- just responding to Tiff's. Nobody's ever emailed us responding to anything on here. That's really sad. I wonder if anybody even reads this besides our friends. Probably not. Argh we need to reach the world!!!!! lol it's almost St. Patrick's Day!!!! Tiff's having a party except now my show choir show-off thing is that same night so I don't know f I'm not gonna be able to go or she's gonna have it on a different night or what. i'm gonna go check the mail. I love mail!!!! lol maybe I'll get my YM magazine that's LATE by the way. Blah it's not here yet. Uually it's here by 4:00. GRR maybe we got a substitute mail dude. Substitutes are always late. yup. It's raining. MAybe I won't get to go to Wally World. Man that sucks. I bet Tiff is playing in the rain. Or not. I went to see The Passion of the Christ. it's good but really brutal. That whole movie is basically beating Jesus. It's really sad- not an uplifting movie at all really besides the end where he comes back to life. I don't like depressing movies. Just comedy and stupid humor. Like Scary Movie 3!!! I love that movie!!! Scary Movie's ok and Scary Movie 2 sucks. But Scary Movie 3 rocks my socks!!!! I'm buying it when it comes out on DVD. I heard that Simple Plan's making another CD too- GOTTA BUY THAT!!!! :D :D :D :D I'm excited! Herm I'll see if my brother wants to go to Wally World with me- it's too boring to go alone. Going alone is just... lonesome. lol So I'll talk at ya'lls later. 3*5*04 *Tiff* heeeeeyy! hows everybody?! thats great! lol I'm waiting for Al to pick me up to go to the lock in tonight at 10 until 7 tomorrow mornin'. lol hoping that it's funnerER then conversion-conversion was depressing, no mt.dew ..like a teensy cup lol. Nothin to do either..argh, well what can ya do? I don't really got nothing to say ew 8:34 it's seriously haunting me this is creepy geez. I already feel tired lol not good gar probably just because I'm home and not doing anything at all I just need to go somewhere and DO something yep thats what I gotta do yep yep I can cure this. I had to pee a lot today like a lot lot very lot idk why just did hm yeah why did I mention that? because I feel the need to pee again lol. Room smells a lot like febreeze very springtime fresh lol I love febreeze especially since my house always smells like dogs ya know? yeah maybe you don't yeah if you had a dog THEN YOU WOULD KNOW except just seems like my house smells so much worse then everyone else's (um probably because it does..lol). I wonder when Allison will show up herm herm herm nerp! idk whoa cool moodring is really blue. ^^I broke a thousand hearts, before I met you. I'll break a thousand more baby before I am through.^^ haha listening to B-B-B-Bad to the Bone. Okay really gotta go pee now lol. Weird, pee was clear..weird lol-happens when you drink lots of water but yeah I don't think I had that much water hmm.weeird. I lost my sheet with the way to make the cool little lines over the letters-the accents for different accents I think Josh stole it he needs to give it back..lol. I have too much free time. Oh my gosh how did I ever sit at my house all day? I used to ALWAYS be home when I was little-ALWAYS ..man I NEVER went anywhere lol except school..thats sad, I don't know how I did it man I mean I've been here for like 4 hours and I'm dying of boredom..can't take it..AHHHH! Somebody save me! Time goes so slow. haha just heard a weird saying last night "A watched pot never boils" I guess it's common but yeah I've never heard it lol. I like saying it's fun to just go around and say a bunch to people and see if they get annoyed or if maybe they'll think you're smart lol. I'm gonna try to memorize a bunch by time I get old so everything I say can just be some weird mind game-ya know like all those really wise old guys in movies..wouldn't that be awesome? I think that it would be. 2 weeks to spring break YAY! gonna go booooooowling! woooop! 3*8*04 *AL* BOWLING!!! Awesome!!!! Today is the day that I got my permit!!! Woop woop!!! I missed 5. Then my mom let me drive the van around the block and I almost ran into a parked car. That would of been bad so good thing I didn't ya know? lol We're gonna go to the creek over Spring Break too!!! The creek is fun- you get all dirty and stuff then we all look homeless lol. I'm bored today so I can't think of anything to write. Sorry- LTE really is dwindling- good thing Tiff writes on here too or else it might be gone!!! AHHHHH 3*9*04 *Tiff* Dang Al like 4 lines here I go to write my 4 lines too. I got my permit today too yep (1st try hahahahahahaha) lol yeah but I missed 7 so I BARELY passed the thing..eeek. I'm an organ donor! :D lol so when I'm there dying on the street they're not even gonna attempt to save me just ya know kill me steal my organs and stuff to give away. Ha, yeah but yeah oh well I'm dying anyway might as well. Hmm yeah hard to think of stuff idk what to put sorta hungry but not really just ya know lol want to eat since I'm at home and er thats what I do when I'm at my house isn't it? yeeeah...my dad finished all the chimichangas they're GOOOD they look sorta narsty but taste good..like a burrito sorta. Yum...too bad Tiff they're gone. I like Huong's idea with the song thing it's cool to have a song every week that you like because yeah I like lots of songs and I always just sing them on this..to make it longer lol..and in the ntbk too w/ everyone because yeah I just like songs. Well maybe I'll write later since I typed so very very little (yeah sad I know..oh well) alrighty! YEEEEPPPERS! I came back! here is my song for today that I like lol I like lots of songs but yeah man everyone is gonna make fun of my song lol. ^^I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons, finally content with the past I regret. I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness. For once I'm at peace with myself. I've been burdened with blanks, trapped in the past for too long. I'm moving on. I've lived in this place and I know all the faces, each one is different but they're always the same. They mean me no harm but it's time that I face it, they'll never allow me to change. But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong..I'm moving on. I'm moving on at last I can see, life has been patiently waiting for me, and I know, there's no guarantees but I'm not alone. There comes a time in everyones life when all you can see are the years passing by. And I have made up my mind that those days are gone. I sold what I could, and packed what I couldn't. Stopped to fill up on my way out of town. I've loved like I should, but live like I shouldn't. I had to lose everything to find out. Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road. I'm moving on. I'm moving on....I'm moving on.^^ That's the entire song..it's good I like it, so shoot me lol. 9:44..herm Wednesday tomorrow..lol hump day! middle of the week we're coming towards the end. Yay! then next week is the last one and then spring break yippee! but IF me and Allison (Tina maybe too) do soccer we might have practice EVERY DAY oh wow every day lol.

Hey did EVERYONE know that the goverment built a big underground city thing so if we got into nuclear war they could all go live underground?? like so the goverment would still be running - I thought it was selfish yeah but I guess it makes sense since yeah you'd want the government working so it wasn't complete chaos even though it sorta is huh. 3*11*04 SCHRINKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm dying of boredom...SOMEBODY SAAAVE MEE!!! can't take it!! waaaaaaaaaah! yeah okay sorry about that guys. I really want to put a page for lyrics on my website but I can't figure it out! It doesn't let me have any spaces so I can't get it to work! garrrrarrrarrr why not? I'm listening to poison..something to believe in. It's a sad song. Listening to morningstar by A.F.I earlier it's sad too..I made it into an away message. When my dad messed up my computer I lost all of my away messages..and I had a lot. Most of them were songs that I liked and I took all that time to type them now they're gone. ^^Well I see him on the TV. Preachin' 'bout the promised land. He tells me to believe in Jesus, and steals the money from my hand. Some say he was a good man, but Lord I think he sinned...^^ continue on and on. I don't really type that much on here. Whenever I get on I only put a little bit and then yeah nothing. I wonder who reads this. No one sends us emails telling us what they think about the stuff we bring up. BLAH getting a headache from being bored..eh..all I did today was walk up to McDonald's and get a chicken sandwich..on the dollar menu $1.07. Mayo all warm from the chicken. Took me 27 minutes to walk up there and go in and order and get my food and walk back home. Was it all worth it?? lol. Sure why not I was bored anyway. My mom came home and got Randy starburst, and Robby some weird candybar..and herself a 3 musketeers but yeah didn't bring me anything. I was watching her give them their candybars and didn't say anything. They all hate me lol. They favor the little boys. Blah..gay. lol. I was mad..lol. Man I'm hungry! Yeah see we have no food at all in our house so if anyone wants to eat they have to leave and go somewhere and get it. Boys are still whining about my parents not going grocery shopping when they got candy bars. Ungrateful little vermon..lol. I was on intyjunk a lot today. Didn't really post anything just reading a bunch. I should read my book, but I don't feel like it. Spring break in only a week! awesome! Oh yeah the variety show was really good. Me and Al and Josh all voted for the cowbell one number 4 it was awesome. Except! if anyone asks Al voted for number 1 okay lol. Oh well no one is going to read this anyway right nobody evil enough to be that evil...right? Okay. I wonder if people DO read this..hmm...I wonder lol. Why would they? probably not intersting just all about other people's lives..I read all of Josh's LTE and everything that Al writes on here of course but yeah I find it interesting lol. I wonder if anyone else is like me...lol easily amused (HA!) actually idk if I'm that easily amused..I always thought that I was. Maybe I am sometimes with certain things but other things I think are retarded. I wonder if my grade in English went up from a C. I shouldn't have gotten a C. I did all of my work and all of it was on time and none of it was THAT crappy lol it wasn't THAT good but not THAT crappy. A couple of my papers were pretty good -for me- well so I thought I guess. She told me it's just because we haven't done much in that class so everyones grade is low. If we haven't done that much then wouldn't the grades be higher? hmmmm. We have JA in that class now but the guy is pretty good. He is a hairdresser lol...he gave everyone his business card..heh. He says he's a very social person and loved school when he was a kid...weirdo lol I hate school it's so boring. I updated my site a lot today too. I put everything into little groups like the quiz group and the choster website group and the website website group. I've been on aim ALL DAY...ar but NOBODY is on! everyone always asks why I'm not on and now that I am on they aren't on..well not everyone just SOME people. I gotta go pee, guess this is a good ending spot lol. 3*15*04 *AL* HAPPY BIRTHDAY NUONG!!!!!!!! ok hey hey hey everyone I know I haven't typed forever Lo siento Lo siento okay herm we're singing these stupid songs in acapella by these King's Singers people and it's E guys and they all look gay and one of them wears girl sandels and sings really really high. And all they do is take other people's songs and arrange them differently so they sound stupid. yup yup But there is this one cool one called Blackbird- blackbird singing in the dead of night... spread your broken wings and learn to fly.. all y life.. blackbird singing in the dead of night.. open your sunken eyes and learn to see... all my life... yeah nerp herm nerp herm oh guess what?! I went driving yesterday- my first time. I went over to K Mart and drove around the parking lot and around some neighborhoods and then I drove fromK mArt to my house which isn't very far but it was good for my first time. And I practiced parking and reversing and turning and blah blah blah.....it's hard to stay under the speed limit though WOOHOO this is the last week before spring break AWESOME!!!! We're going bowling and creeking, and 5 Pointing and walking and all kinds of fun stuff IF it doesn't snow all week cuz it snowed today which is retarded cuz Spring is in E days- so it shouldn't be sowing! iowa is retarded. St. Patrick's Day is Wednesday coolio- even thought I'm only like half Irish and you can't even tell hah Tiff is way more Irish- at leats she has red hair. OH YEAH I remembered something- on some IQ test thinger the two top scores were girls and out of everyone redheads scored the highest then blondes and then brunettes so blondes aren't so stupid after all!!! It's all those brunettes out there! geez lol And bald men scored the highest for the guys. Interesting huh?????? :D If your IQ is over 130 you're considered a genius but I don't think I'm a genius and I got like 164 on one and 142 on another- I think those were messed up though cuz they were on the website- like at Spark and stuff. Shoop doop- ahh my parents are lucky!!! They're going to Mexico over Spring Break!!!! I wanna go!!! lol I'm gonna be doing soccer everyday with Tiff- man I'm gonna die I havent playeed since 2nd grade!!! I need cleats and shingards and shorts and socks and get a physical- ahh lots of money and then what if I don't like it??? Tiff's gotta help me lol- maybe I should go running before conditioning or else it might like be too much since I never exercise or anything. 4:47- hah cool time I like it I like it a lot!!!!! ok I'm retarded- maybe we won't do anything this Friday- that would be cool if we just had a bunch of parties and stuff :D :D :D :D I like parties- maybe I'll have a birthday party forever- like at my 127th birthday Iwould still have one- maybe if I have some money I'll get everyone a granny skateboard- awesome lol. I probably won't have money though cuz I got this new idea that I want to do mission work. I've always thought that every job sounded boring or had no purpose and then these people came to my church and talked about missioning and it was like THAT'S what I want to do. But idk it might change. And Idon't think you have to go to college for that and I want to go to college so I might pick a different job. Alrighty I'll write more later....adios! 3*17*04 *AL* HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY!!!!!!! 3*19*04 *Tiff* HeYa ChOsTeRs! do you all think it's annoying when people do that or cool? just wondering, it's okay sometimes but yeah too much is annoying I guess. Well YAY! Spring break! my goosh they made us go to school for 4 straight weeks thats like a month! geez. I bought my cleats for soccer they are blue nike cleats ..my red ones were better oh well only came in E 1/2 too small for me. We have practice all spring break bleeh bleh bleh at Jackson elementary school. The goonies stay together!~ cool. SoOoOoOoOoOo what is everyone doing over spring break? Maybe you should EMAIL us eh? yeah I think yeah. Man man why does it take so long to be able to talk on this thing..like I get an idea after so much suffering of what to talk about oo soccer soccer! why would you guys care about soccer? you aren't playing?! so why do you care? why would you want to read about soccer? thats like my little thing I'm doing..I bet no one cares lol. I mean yeah I care because it's me dur but you all probably could care less gosh why do you even read this! It must be so incredibly boring reading about someone else's life!!! Hey I've got an idea why don't you TELL US what you think of our rants about things about whats going on in our lives eh? EMAIL US! lol the email address hermnerp@yahoo.com is at the bottom of the page! please tell us what you think please! OH I'd also like to recommend a good website internetjunk.org it's cool we both go there now and yeah like talk. You know if you all actually do the stuff I say and read this lte then thats sorta creepy I mean you must know a lot about us? freaky..sorta stalkerish actually lol..not really I guess since we post it online for the entire world to see and beg you all to go and read it but still...it's creepy I mean like you know so much and we know..so very little...freaky. I need a shower lol. I'm in a gang! heheheehehehe we meet every school day and we're a big cool intimidating gang. The schkrickers/shkrinkers yeah my word is the first one but my gang can't say it right they say it the other way...oh well thats cool too. Schkricker is an awesome word! Dude! It's awesome! 3*20*04 *AL* hehehe I'm on at 7:55 AM and nobody else feels the need to be on at this exact moment I guess cuz all that's on my buddy list is computers... ahhh ....I feel so alone! HA not really I just feel cool cuz I'm here and nobody is...yeah. Schkricker- I can say it- idk if I spelled it right though. I don't feel like going back and checking how to spell it. Yup along with Tiff's reccomendation- I would reccomend going to internetjunk.org too highly exciting FOR SERIOUS and you can chat with people from all over the world about debatey type stuff hmm not really chat but post stuff back and forth kind of- it's called forums but that word just doesn't make sense...... except I've only done 11 posts and Tiff's done like 80 something so I'm only a Jr. Member and she's just a Member. oh well I'll be there sometime- someday I will have the honor of being a member and when that time comes oh I will be so happy. LOL yeah my parents are in Mexico right now having a great time while Im stuck in crappy Iowa!!!!! AHHHHHHH save me the torture!!!!!! But yeah I'll have fun cuz today Tiff is coming over to play soccer around sometime I still gotta call her and tell her to bring ze hammer!!!!!! :D :D :D :D We haven't traded in a while. And I'm going to Wisconsin Dells for two days and we're planning on going bowling sometime and i might be going to a movie too so yup should have some fun over Spring Break yip yip yip My throat hurts and I keep sniffling and coughing and it's really annoying REALLY annoying!!!! AHHHHH cold's suck I like to be healthy and ENERGIZED!!!!! exclamation points are so much more exciting than periods. UMMMMMM my favorite smell is laundry detergent and Tiff's driveway always smells like it. At the mall there's this one cadle that's called clean cotton and it smells like laundry detergent!!!! Tiff likes Febreze- pretty smelly good too. Somebody let off a stink bomb at our school the other day and it smelled like sewer or dead people or something but it smelled really bad. really really bad..... it was nasty. yeah Anyways I'm kinda hungry so I think I'll eat some breakfast! I'm proud to say that I DO NOT skip breakfast like most people do- I'm a full fledged breakfast eater!!!!!!!! *Tiff* same day -I had 91 posts on inty junk :D. heheheheeh!!! I haven't eaten breakfast either...but I don't know what I'm going to have..maybe my parents went grocery shopping last night while I was gone -COOL then maybe we will have something good like Reese's puffs or something. Hey know what breakfast food is gross! The only good breakfast food is like yeah cereal what else is there? waffles no I don't like them pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausages etc..all nasty. French toast no. Toast is pretty good but only sometimes, but I LOVE cereal ....love cereal yum yum cereal is the best! heheheh! okay yeah so today I'm going to go play soccer today I don't know where...hmmmm. Yeah cuz Al hasn't played for years and years so now we are going to go practice.Cut off -nerner *AL* huh? yeah same day again lol I saw Tiff and Josh walking down Kimberly today and we honked at them and I was waving at them but they like didn't recognize the car cuz it was my sunt's and then we pulled into Walgreen's and I jumped out of the car and waved at them but they just ran away and came back and stood there so idk if they knew it was me or not.. but who else would wave at them anyways like a crazy person????? lol And then jump out of the car while it's still driving? cool I think I'm gonna go see Secret Window today- looks cool. yup yup extremly bored- we didn't get to play soccer today cuz I thought we were gonna go see a movie but we still haven't and it's 5:00 so I guess we could have played soccer but it IS really windy the ball coulda blown away maybe but err I hate when people say they're gonna do something and then they don't but I think we might still go to the movie idk I'm not really making sense just a big run-on sentence. So yup catcha later Bill and Ted!!!! oh yeah I lost my cool sheet that told how to do the accents too. :( yummy grapes........ 3*23*04 *AL* hallo again everyone!!! So my spring break's been ok.... lol I don't really feel like complaining. Today's my first day of soccer practice since I was in Wisconsn Dells yesterday. So hopefully I don't die from running so much. That would suck. lol Ok I really have nothing to write. Tiff hasn't been here in a while AHHHHH she has caught my syndrome thingy..... yeah 3*24*04 *Tiff* What're you talkin' about? I get on and type more then you do..I think so..well actually probably not. Dude it is spring break I don't want to sit at home and type on the LTE.. but of course look what I am doing right now..lol. Yeah of course. It's only like 10 am though so it's early doesn't mean that I'm gonna be stuck here doing this all day. I could find something to do. Doubt that we can go bowling blaaaaaaah gar because of weightlifting at like 2:50..too early. You know I really like playing defense...I enjoy it a lot more when I play that and not forward. Defense is way funner you just have to go and get the ball away from the person and if they pass you, you just run really fast and catch up and try again then kick it really hard wooohoo! Where is everyone? I'm on aim but nobody is on..argh. I added a quiz to my website! wooooop! Man man if I wrote on the LTE each time I got online then it would probably be really long but usually I don't because my mind is blank and I can't think of what to write about. I went to see 50 first dates last night..heheh I liked it..cute little penguin Willy and that one creepy dude. There are some parts that are pretty corny but I've seen WAAAAAY worse. I'm going to collapse at soccer practice today while we are running because my ankle is messed up and hurts and it's hard to walk even so yep definitely dead. It's supposed to rain today! AWESOME! get to play soccer in the rain..fun fun fun cooooool..heheheeheheh! 3*27*04 HEY everybody yeah no soccer in the rain but yesterday we got to jump in a huge puddle! It was cool..yesterday was cool..hm...except for like yeah it was sorta hard I guess, it didn't FEEL hard but it should have felt hard because yeah we ran 2 laps bending over and jumping up and high knees and butt kicks then had to jump over the ball back and forth and spring (I'm not so good at that one lol) and THEN we ran the mile and 40 meters and got timed BLAAAH..gar yeah then we scrimaged so actually we did a lot but it was pretty fun. ^^Take your records, take your freedom, take your memories I don't need 'em. Take your space and all your reasons but you'll think of me.^^ sort of a weird song but I got it stuck in my head yesterday. I woke up somewhat early today like 7:30 ish and yeah I like it a lot more then waking up late..it feels nice, I wish everyone in my family like didn't live with me because yeah then I could wake up like that every day and it would be nice. Wake up on my own instead of everyone screaming and yelling and waking me up blaah I hate it. GAR! I hate when they are loud before I go to bed too..I want to cut their heads off..RARR! This sucks though..spring break coming to a close..wah. lol I don't want to go back to school, 2 months left...ah my gash thats too long. Weird I just noticed at the bottom of the page there is this big thing for advanced editor? Okay I don't know what that means. Weird...where did that come from....weird. MY BROTHERS ATE MY COCOA PUFFS!!! WAAAAAAAAH!!!!! booohoooooooohoooooooooo!! I was yeah..deeply hurt..I really was...they always eat all of my cereal, like all of my food actually..it's sad. They ate my colby jack cheese too..so sad..now I'm left with nothing to eat. Don't you all feel so sorry for me? lol yeeah I'm sure. Okay I keep THINKING that I'm done typing and go to check how many K's there are and there is always 156 it's impossible to get to 157 (a way cooler number). That's FRUITY lol. heh. I kind of have a craving for bagel bites, weird isn't it? I haven't had bagel bites in forever. I think I'm going to write them on the list thingy! Yay! but we all know what will happen if I do that....they will be eaten..and not by me...RARRR!!! Stupid orangehead and that other nasty one..ew. Nerp Nerp Nerp. YaY! guys I got to 157! yay! 3*27*04 *AL* HEYA haven't written in a while.. I'm gonna try to write 13K so Tiff won't see the thingy in the E0's but idk if I can- maybe. heheh hmmmmmm blah my parent's flight got delayed- they were supposed to come home yesterday at 8:00 then it got delayed until 10:30 and then there was no more flights so they had to spend the night in the hotel and come back at 9:30 this morning but then that got canceled so now they're driving home in a rental car at this very minute. yup yeah so I haven't seen them in lik a week now- you people will probably think I'm weird for missing them but yeah I do-I like my parents. Most of the time lol. freaky it's EE degrees outside. We went bowling on Thursday and played 5 games cuz at Leisure Lanes it's only $2 per game and $1 for shoes. really cheap and way better than Bowlmor. But I got like 82- that was my best score and Tiff had like 90 something but josh got like 150 cuz he was really good that day for some reason and could do these cool spinny things where the ball curves around right by the gutter but then turns and makes a strike. yeah kind of confusing to explain- ya gotta see it. Oh yeah we made it through our first week of soccer and good news- I didn't die!!! See I'm still here typing lol. But we did the mile yesterday and it must have been a messed up mile cuz me and Tiff both were faster than we ever had been but I got like 7:25 and the fastest Iever had was 8:49 and that was in like 4th grade. Iusually get 10:00 now but not yesterday. I was proud of myself. lol yup yup yup lol ah my gash hehehehehe funny......... only 1 1/2 days left of Spring break boohooooooo argh but then we get a 4 day weekend over Easter so that's cool. Josh's birthday is April 12th so it would be cool to put stuff in plastic eggs and have an Easter egg hunt. lol maybe like some PLASTIC GRENADES!!!!! lol we got an evil bug in my house cuz it bit me or something and left this rash thing on my back that looks like a rabbit head. It's weird..... evil thing. nothing to do.... so bored where is everyone????? oh man there's physical fitness testing on Monday and all through next week gaaaaaaaah noooooo all I can do is the sit n' reach and MAYBE now the mile halfway fast but the pull-ups are impossible- never got one in my life- and the shuttle run is stupid and sit ups are just tiring. BLAH stupid things. I can't wait until the summer so we can go walking and exploring and swing on willow trees!!!! that was fuuuuuuun. WEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOO excitement time!!!!woosh woosh yippee yahahahahah yippity skippity ok that was fun. Herm ya'll should go to Tiff's evil page on her website- it's actually cool even though it's supposed to be evil so it kind of contradicts itself. Bit that's ok- that's what makes it cool. Iliek when stuff doesn't make sense. Like my signs on my wall that say No Parking and Private Drive. See? They don't make any sense. heheheh The whole back of my door is covered in the magazine pictures from the Buckle. I was really bored so now it's like a collage. They're not even that cool of pictures either. And my closet is covred in Pokemon cards. lol I'm weird. Pokemon are really old- I just like the cards. oh yeah I saw lots of movies this week- Secret Window- really stupid, don't see it, the ending sucks. umm 50 First Dates- awesome, go see it, really funny. Cold Creek Manor- stupid, boring, not what you think it is. Dickie Roberts Former Child Star- okay, kind of funny in some parts. yeah see the only one I liked is 50 First Dates. :D yum I want some spring oreos!!!! herm I'm really bored- maybe I'll get some more quizzes for my website. Wonder how much I've typed? only 160K? that's crap. I just noticed the Advanced Editor thingy too. Weird I never noticed it before. Okay it looks like I've failed my mission cuz I've run out of things to type. sorry for the evil numbers Tiff. lol *Tiff* lol Josh's birthday is April 10th not April 12th. Yeah anyway ..we have arrived at the end of Spring Break. (Oh yeah Al btw I read your email that I was supposed to read by E:00 at about 9:53 lol sorry yeah stupid Roberta never told me, oh and yeah that kind of stuff like youth group and stuff yeah better if I know in advance otherwise I'll be gone like I usually am). I went walking in the rain today, rain was nice but it was CHILLY brr, me and Josh talked about this -it's sort of weird lol- but okay what if YOU were a parent and your kids were sexually active? what would you do? I mean that is a hard situation when you think about it because theres not many good ways of handling it? WELL I only brought that up so I could ask people to send us EMAILS about what THEY would do! Thanks! Yeah even though I already know no one will answer. Okay well I think that I would have a big talk about how easy a girl could get pregnant and I would ask them if they were going to do it to just make sure they would use protection and I would even offer to buy some if they wanted me to, yeah then talk about like STD's and how about why it would be a nice choice to wait for marriage because it would be special - and if you really cared about that person -then you would wait. Yep and all that stuff like the people who go in to classes like for health classes and talk about pregnancy and STD's and all that good stuff yeah just like one of those people lol that would be me hahahahaha, but ya know the parents who would ground there kid and stuff like from seeing that person -it's sort of stupid because then the kid is just going to try harder and start going totally against the parent -it would at least be better to talk to the kid and like be on the same page and stuff rather then against each other. Hey I thought of another one -what would you do if your kid was gay? (or lesbian) thats a weird one..man..that would be uncomfortable lol. I don't even know what I would do..hm...weird. Well of course I'd accept it and stuff but it would be weird..lol. Yeah but thats your kid and if thats the way they are theres not too much you can do about it..whoa weird- hm..okay theres another one if you have an answer for the what would you do if your kid was gay question then SEND US AN EMAIL telling us in GREAT DETAIL about what you would do. Thanks all of your emails are greatly appreciated! 3*30*04 *AL* Ok hey yup I knew Josh's birthday was April 10th just a typo ya know- I always have typos... man the 2 is really far away from the 0 though- that was a really crappy typo! lol Um yeah anyways guess I'll answer these "topics of discussion" lol Um okay- if my kids were sexually active... yeah I would be REALLY disappointed because I'm hoping I'm going to be the kind of parent who talks enough to their kids and teaches them about it enough so that they don't do it until marriage and I'm planning on bring ing them up in a Christian enviroment so that would also be really disappointiong to know that they were doing that anyways. If it was my daughter and she got pregnant I would for sure have her keep the baby and help her raise it but I would have a hard time forgiving my daughter or my son but I wouldn't stop talking to them or anything or "disown" them- that's a little too harsh for your own kids. But I think that everyone can start over- and I'd work hard on helping them stay unsexually active (?) until marriage- Ialso belive that it's important to save it until marriage and have it be special for that one person. Idk I could really get into but yeah it involves a lot of my personal beliefs and I don't want to "impose" them on anyone- people sometimes get mad. lol okay If my kid were gay or lesbian.. ah man that's really hard... I would have a really hard time accepting it but I guess I would have to eventually since their my kids right? lol no I would... but yeah once again it would be realy disappointing to find out that they chose to go that route- for more than one reason... and I mean it's not that I'm discriminative against gay people or anything - it's just that I don't believe it's morally right- but I accept them and talk to them (yeah I know one gay guy) but... yeah idk it would be really really hard. bleh I don't really even want to think about it. herm oh yeah I was reading Leviticus in the Bible the other day for some reason and idk it's really weird-like kind of freaky. It talks about sacrafices and rules and stuff- it's the only Book that's ever kind of freaked me out. lol I'm planning on trying to read the whole Bible. I kind of feel bad for never doing it... okay sometimes it's hard to know what you can and can't write on this thing cuz you don't know who's reading it- I mean you'd think you could write anything right- since it's yours and all- but you can't cuz people get mad....lol today in school we did some Career Interest Survey- and you had to put your top two choices in careers- and I don't have any idea so I put Graphic Design (kind of interested in it0 and Movie Director- lol sounded cool to me even though I never plan on doing it lol. And then we had to put our top two hobbies and Iput languages and travel- there wasn't much to choose from. Yeah- we had litte choices for everything- you didn't just get to make stuff up. There was world wide web surfing too but eh I don't really like to surf- just put stuff on this website and mine, go to intyjunk, and talk on AIM. lol >>>>>>> cool <<<<<<< little arrow things.. heheh So soccer was freezing cold tday- it was like 30 some degrees out and I had shorts and short sleeves on but then Tiff had extra long sleeve shirts and sweatshirt and then my mom brought me some pants and a sweatshirt too. :D lol But yeah my body doesn't really function in the cold. AHHHH need to live somewhere warm!!! Not in stupid freezing cold Iowa!!!!!! I can't wait to leave this place- and go to Colorado!!! But hm not much warmer huh? lol oh well so yeah me and Tiff both got put on the Junior Varsity team for SOME reason- okay well Tiff's actually played before but me??? NO never played since 2nd grade!!! WHY somebody tell me WHY am I on the JV team??? I have no idea what I'm doing and the coach wants me to play some position that tells people when to move and stuff and "talks" to everyone! AHH I can't talk to people! I can't tell them what to do cuz IDK!!!! lol Idk what I'M supposed to do so how should I know what they're supposed to do??? argh it's so stupid. The sopomores should have been put on JV. Doesn't that make more sense than freshmen? yeah... but grr oh well maybe I'll get the hang of it by the end of the season! :D lol but all we do is run and do drills every single day... man I can't have repetition to much or I get BORED- yeah I get tired of stuff REALLY fast hehe but not Mt. Dew... lol I get bored and I'm impatient.. but I'm really hyper- maybe that makes up for it lol. Oh yeah we played human foozball in soccer today too- that was easy- way easier than regular soccer anyways. lol. Maybe I'll check the email and see if anybody sent anything. lol 3*4*04 HEYA! Okay getting right into it. I am feeling happy for spring coming. Usually I don't like spring, it's like a ick stupid season but this year I'm seeming to like it a lot. Weird? yeah I know. I think now that it's a happy season and I like it. I still definitely like fall muchos muchos times more because it's cool but yeah Spring isn't as bad as I always made it out to be. I really love colby jack cheese. I'm eating it now, it's good. Colby Jack stuff in case you don't know is that cheese with the yellow/white AND orange. hah awesome -it even looks cool. Like a cow sorta...a orange and yellow/white. I don't know if I should call it yellow or white because it looks more white but it feels weird saying white cheese. lol. Yeah it shouldn't I'm just weird thinking all cheese should be yellow. I checked out a Steinbeck book from the library on Friday and yeah I'm on like page 30 something and I'm already bored. BUT ya know actually I'm not sure if it's that I'm actually bored rather then just wanting a shorter book. Ya see this book is E01 pages..thats a lot. I don't want to read another book thats that long. Thats long lol. It's not AS interesting as Desperation (my Stephen King book) was either so I don't know if I'd get it done as fast as that one. That one was 547 pages and yeah I read the last 200 pages in like 2 days haha. I wonder what I'm gonna do today..no school Sunday woooohoooo! yay! I got 100 posts and Inty Junk! cool huh? I'm not very good at posting because I always think everyone else is way smarter then me and whatever I say is gonna be REALLY stupid lol which it is but I try not to sound as dumb as I am. hah. I finally got 100. Sheesh. Yeah when I first joined there I never typed anything on the message board thingers, all I did was take the quizzes from test results..heheh and put them on my website. I've been adding some quizzes lately I don't know how many there are but just saying I added some. hm I kinda want the trees to get leaves..I miss the leaves..lol. I like leaves. Leaves are nice. If you think leaves are nice then send us an email about how much you like leaves..we'd be glad to read anything you send. lol.

I don't want to go at all blah! YaY! I don't even want to play JV I just want to play fresh soph because yep it's waaaaaaaaay cooler! JV is too serious and I'm too jokey to play it, I'm not as worried about being a really good player as I am about having a good time! A bunch of people on our team always get mad at us for laughing and stuff and talking and they yell at us and seperate us and then say they're going to make us run if you don't shut up. Yep. They get mad..eh..too serious about it, I guess some people are playing to get good but gosh..don't have to ruin ALL of my fun geez. lol. Eric is trying to get me to play forward now..I suck at it..suck at defense too though lol..but maybe not AS bad...no not as bad as forward definitely not...heheheh. Forward is hard because yeah I have problems trying to get the ball past the defenders..it's hard. I need to learn some tricks that I'll actually be able to use..heh. We learn them but I'm too retarded lol. Ah oh well. I kinda wanna switch some freshman who actually WANTS to play on JV just so I don't have to. I really don't want to, the jerseys are kinda cool but yeah I DONT CARE! Still stinks. heh I said stinks. 4*11*04 HEYA! Happy Easter Everybody! :D :D :D ^^I believe in a thing called love!^^ thats all the lyrics that I know. Okay need to get ready to go to church so I better go just wanted to say happy easter to everyone..bye! OKAY I'm back! Glowbowling was awesome! Only crap thing was that we got the last lane..maaaan. So it wasn't as black lighty as before..next time we go we'll have to reserve a lane. Oh yeah and at the beginning they were playing music that was sorta retarded. I like when they play songs I know because I sing along..heh it's fun! I'm going to Al's in like an hour for Easter cuz my family isn't doing anything..we don't ever do anything anymore with the family (YAY!!!!) hah. ^^How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad? Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad. I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral. Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve. I have a history of taking off my shirt!^^ Chickity China the Chinese Chicken, you have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'! 4*14*04 *AL* Heya everybody!!! yup haven't typed in a while- cuz yeah just been sort of busy! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIFF!!!! Actually it's tomorrow lol but I'm not gonna have time to type tomorrow cuz of the JV game. BLAH!!! I don't like the games- I just wanna go to practice cuz then when I play in games and I mess up people yell at me and get mad. Soooo yeah games suck. And it's sort of hard for me to play in a game because there's not like one little bit of competiveness in me at all so I don't really care if we wein or lose- Ijust wanna have fun but other people kind of get mad when I think that way. Oh well too bad for them. hehehe Yup so the four day weekend totally rocked man! LOL okay well Friday we had soccer practice so that wasn't all that great but Saturday we didn't have to go to the JV game and me and Tiff and Josh all went to Tiff's house and had some fun taking pictures..... not gonna elaborate on that lol it's not gross or anything just yeah I'm not gonna say anything more lol then we went to Josh's birthday/Easter party and had jello eggs! YUM! :D and some good jalepeno cheese bread. Then glow bowling like Tiff said! I love glow bowling- it's my favorite thing now!!! then Sunday went to church and Tiff came over after that and we watched Kung Pow!! And then hahahahahah my grandma gave me this purple sweater thing- AHHHH it was really ugly and she kept telling me that I wouldn't like it even before I opened it so then I DID open it and I DIDN'T like it so I just started almost cracking up and I could tell Tiff and my cousin were gonna start cracking up so when she left the room we did and she heard us- oops. lol but then they put the stupid thing on me. AHH scary.... then Monday more soccer practice- fun fun yippie! not geez. So then we had a soccer game on Tuesday- and Tiff played for like 15 minutes and I played for 5 out of a 90 minute game- what a waste. And plus it was freezing to death so we just sat all huddled in a blanket the whole time. lol and then we stopped by Tiff's grandma's house and took a picture and stole her candy. lol So yup and now it's Wednesday woop woop man I like updated you on my whole life. lol i wish it was summer. yeeeeeah awesome song!!! >I belive in a thing called love! Just listen to the rhythm of my heart!< >Touching you... touching me.. touching you and you're touching me!!!> yeah something like that I don't really know it- just little parts of it. lol oh yeah I forgot to tell you about Brunswick and Len and Ebonite! Bruswick was this really cool bowling ball at glow bowling and Len was cool for me and Josh but Tiff didn't like him- she liked Ebonite so then we just ended up getting rid of them cuz they were repelling eachother or something. lol so yeah anyways guess I'll be backaround Saturday probably yuuuup adios!! 5*2*04 *Tiff* MAN! no one has typed here forever! It's not our fault! My whole computer got the trojan horse virus lol. No I didn't make it up, so my internet was screwed up there for awhile.

I think it'd be fun. FUN FUN FUN. I always do that, just have people on my buddy list so I can look at their profiles. It's fun to read people's profiles :D :D :D. ^^Have you ever felt abandoned? felt so lost that you were stranded? just like all the walls were closing in and you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered, stuck under a tree in thunder..seems to be no way out but there is one when in doubt.^^ Dude you know what there are only like 3 or 4 soccer games left that I have to go to! Isn't that cool? I know. Unless we go to regionals which I doubt it..sure hope not lol. I don't wannnaaaa! Today I'm going to something with Josh cuz yeah was gonna go to youth group with Al but there isn't youth group lol. Huong went bowling with us last night it was awesome it was her first time bowling and she got like E0-something! lol I did really bad the first time I went bowling lol...hehe. Allison did really really good it was because of Larry the awesome ball someone was going to throw away. CRAZY! Larry's cool. Brunswick was good for me last night he was magical lol. I think maybe Brunswick just felt a little left out because of Larry being so cool lol. He just wanted to get a little attention. Brunswick is a nice ball. lol. 5/12/04 *Tiff* HOLA AMIGOS! again! I decided today that I'm done with soccer, I'm just tired of going..it's the end of the year and I just want to be done with school and anything that has to do with school. I bet you all think I'm retarded for quitting so close to the end..like I should have just finished it right? but NOPE I don't feel like it. Dude if I'm not having fun then why in the hacky sack should I go? I shouldn't! My point in life isn't to torture myself with boredom! lol I mean geez. I don't want to waste my time out on a soccer field when there other stuff that I'd much rather be doing..which is like anything lol. No actually it's not, just that everyone on my team is too serious and stuff they all freak out if we're losing and it kinda annoys me. I mean I don't really care if we lose or not. I'm thinking that I'd be better suited playing dads club lol, yeah you think I'm stupid because it's dads club but you know what at least I'd be having fun, instead of getting all worried about losing and stuff lol. Sports in high school just take up too much of your time...they take too much commitement. I'm not a commitful type of person I don't think lol I remember Allison saying something like that before. It really depends on what it is though I mean sports? a sport isn't something thats important..it's a game. Not life or death. Yep just thought I'd update everyone about that. So what am I doin' tonight..I am DEFINITELY NOT going to the stupid awards ceremony! lol Allison is going but yeah she has academic excellence so she probably should but me psssshhh no. I think I have like Academic Recognition..I thought actually I did better lol but that is the sad truth. I'm even dumber then I thought lol. I finished my East of Eden book..I probably already put that on here huh yeah well anyway yep! Timshel means thou mayest. That was a long book duder E02 pages. WAHOO 12 more days of school thats so awesome! YAAAAAAAY! I'm also writing a story about Weber lol..it's retarded lol. I'll type it on here. **RATS AND OPERA** - Young Bryce was born many years ago to Frederick and Eleanor Weber. At their first sight of him they were filled with shame and embarassment. He has beady little eyes and freakishly curly hair. Frederick and Eleanor were rich folks and couldn't afford to be looked down upon for any reason. Frederick ran his own cottage cheese factory and made a lot of money. He was a very respected businessman. There was no need for Eleanor to work since her husband could easily pay all of the bills and still have tons of money left over. "Oh Frederick I just can't bear to look at him any longer!" "I know my dear, it's absolutely hideous!" "Oh darling please, please rid me of this disgusting thing" Right away dear! All we have to do is sign these papers..I'd be happy to dispose of the little creature." "Frederick we must be certain that no one will ever be aware of his existence!" "Oh Eleanor I would never tell! How embarassing would that be?!" *Puny little Bryce was left at the adoption agency. There he lived for the first 8 years of his life, they were just about to put him to sleep when Bob (the hillbilly who lived out in the country, sorrounding the city) came in drunk one night and said that he wanted a puppy. Bob drove a harley, drank, smoked, chewed and was absolutely obsessed with kitties and rainbows. He was a cat breeding redneck. "Well sir, this is the closest thing to a dog that we've got here." She pointed at Bryce. "Do you want it?" "I dunno ma'am that there mutt is perdy ugly and awfully hairy...I'm my afraid my ma will get her gurtle all tied in a knot if I take that one home." " Sir..please..PLEASE TAKE IT!!!!...eeehem, all it needs is a little grooming." "eh...I guess is alright. * Ma' I's gone down to the pound and those nice people gave me a pup for free! Is a hairy one! You wanna pet em?!" "Howdy sonny, where in corn tootin' didja pick up that there dog, look at theres a fleas all over that thing." Hurry up an' put it in the tub fore those fleas spread all over the house." "Alright ma'" (The next morning, at breakfast) "Well call me a foo' that thing ain't no dog is a boy sonny!" "Fool me too ma'" "So whats is name sonny?" "Came with a weird name, Bryce..sick huh ma'? "What kinda name is that? Who in the worl' names there kid Bryce?" "Tha' sounds like lice huh ma!? ha ha ha ha das funna." "I don wanna call it Bryce." "I got an idea ma' les call it ROVER! ha ha ha!" "Good one sonny! ha ha!" *Bryce-Rover had to do all of the chores that his adopter parents didn't feel like doing. He was the official pooper scooper of the house. He woke up every morning with the rooster and did all his chores..then..it was to school. Bryce-Rover was the nerd at school. In elementary and junior high school the kids would make fun of his hair, and his beady little eyes, they made fun of him because his feet were too big for his body and he was skinny and easy to push around. They also made fun of his allergies..because he was deathly allergic to cats, at home he had many coughing fits and had to be rushed to the hospital because of his Uncle Bob's cat breeding business. It got so bad that Bryce-Rover had to sleep in the barn with the cows..eventually he got fleas again which was just another thing that the kids made fun of him for. *When Bryce-Rover went into high school the jokes got even worse. He never could get a girlfriend..or any friend at all. The kids brought cats to Bryce-Rover's barn just to torture him. Many more runs to the hospital were made. He didn't participate in anything at school except for track. Bryce-Rover was a good runner, he could run fast. He became a fast runner from all the times in elementary school when the kids made fun of him and tried to beat him up. He always ran away from them. He ran away from Uncle Bob's evil cats also..because if he didn't..he would surely have been dead. * Bryce-Rover watched the evil cats (from a distance of course). He watched how they would attack the little rats on the farm. They were evil to the rodents..just like they were evil to Bryce-Rover. Bryce-Rover began taking rats from all over the farmhouse and bringing them to his barn to live with him. He'd try to save them from the evil cats. The rats were his only friends..and he longed for their companionship. *He never had gotten along with either of his adoptee parents. Grandma was obsessed with being a cowboy (or cowgirl..however you want to look at it.) Even at 78 years old she still wanted to ride the bull in the rodeo. She sang country music every night before dinner..which was always pork and beans. She tried to teach Bryce-Rover to be a good horse rider but he definitely sucked at it. She also tried to teach him the banjo and how to sing country songs but he sucked at that too. She told him he was a loser and he'd never amount to nothin'. One night she brought him to a country concert and took him up on stage to sing a duet with her. When it was his turn to sing he busted out some opera and thats when she kicked him out of the barn. It was the only time Bryce-Rover had ever stupid up for himself to anyone. He finally got out of his cowardly shell and rebelled..that was the only time in his life too..he never again would stand up for himself. He's a wishy washy pushover. Before he left the barn he went back and took his friends (the rats). *Bryce-Rover went to college and dropped the Rover. In college he majored in singing, he sang opera and listened to classical music. He hates country music. He was in the choir at his college. He now teaches in Iowa. He sings opera still in his free time and is on a quest to save all the rats of the world. He has rats from all across the globe shipped to him. He goes out looking for rats on days he doesn't have to teach. He has little tubes running through his entire house, and furniture in them so the rats stay comfortable. The rats can stay in the tubes or run around freely, whatever the choose. He names each rat in his house and knows them all personally. They have access to his fridge and his bathtub. They watch his TV, and get to control the remote. Bryce would never argue with his rats, for he loves them too much. The rats are treated like royalty which in his eyes they are. Weber lives like that for the rest of his life and when he dies he leaves everything he owns to his rats. He sure does love them rats..the only friends..he ever had. THE END! I might change some parts later..idk...it's sorta messed up and kinda short maybe I'll add to it eh? HEHE 3*13*04 *AL* ah my gash I haven't typed on here forever! Dude! Tiff your story so totally ROCKED! lol Crush... umm yeah but it was really really cool- my Flinker story really sucked. I can't write at all. Blah. Oh man this stuff I'm drinking tastes like beer. It's sparkling white grap juice but bleh it's kind of nasty. Larry is awesome! I swear he's gotta be magic cuz I never even got over 100 before and I got like 130! And everybody else did really good too. I can't belive someone was gonna throw him away. Geez. Hmmm we gotta but our amiga Cong a bida present tomorrow... hey Tiff wanna just ride home with me and then we'll go from there? I heard she wants the Usher CD and monkey stuff and a hat...... okeeee ANYWAYS me and Tiff and Josh are all planning on making this awesome movie about either 3 armless people or I'm the armless person and they're the people from Josh's stories. (Refer to Josh's LTE. lol) Yeah but the three armless people story would go like Josh finds out that he has magical superhero powers to he calls this meeting for all the armless people of Davenport. It turns out we're the only three. But on the day we're supposed to meet only Tiff and Josh show up so they go looking for me and they find me and I'm a hobo and i'm pretty what the hacky sackish ya know, but we all have powers and we all turn into superheroes. And since we can't use our hands we got special types of shoes- like a whole closet full- and some our jet-pack shoes and some are eating shoes and some are parachute shoes etc. But they all got special air posket hole things that hole stuff and we can put stuff in. yuuuuup yipper skipper! 11 days left of school! Freshman year went by really fast. On Saturday I go to E Flags from E:00 am to 2:00 am but it takes 4 hours there and 4 hours back so we're actually THERE for 12 hours. Superman's gonna awesome and the giant drop. i'm going with Asian Club yip yip! But Tiff's not going cuz E is Evil right so there could be evilness there. She wouldnt go even though I tried to convince her we'd protect her from the evil. Flinker fell off the crappy bus! hehehehe that's what you say when something is crappy- it fell off the crappy bus!!!! lol hahaha she reminds me of this retarded joke that was on my Laffy Taffy the other day- What did the tree say to the math teacher? do do do dododo do do do do do do do dadadadada do do do....(Jeopardy theme) Gee! I'm a tree! (Geomety) yeah hahahahaha idk I guess it's sort of funny- but the cactus/chicken one is way cooler!!!! ahhhhh there's a breadstick on my plastic Olive Garden cup!!! Now I'm craaaaaving breadsticks! Breadsticks are muy muy riquisimos! i was thinking about nasty meat and I think the top 5 grossest meats are: 1) hot dogs! AHHH the nastiness of cow pig and chicken combined into one! 2)brown shwager/liver- groooooooosss need I say more? 3) bologna- also all kinds of animals mushed into one- and it tastes really gross too! 4) meatloaf- yuuuuuck the old fashioned home-made meat but it tastes so disgusting and dry that it would make me sick! 5) ummmm well I can't really think of a 5- I could say steak but ya'llmight maul me so um yeah. lol (Secretly though, that's number 5) oh man 2 days ago I was dumping my tray at the flowing river of garbage and my baked pasta/strawberry syrup/milk/potato/potato gravy mixture splattered up on to the lunch lady's chin and she was like "Thanks a lot!" So I got freaked out and ran away but I was cracking up the whole time- haha it was really funny. But now I'm freaked out by the lunch lady- so I run and dump my tray into the flowing river of garbage really fast and hope she doesn't see me. Scary Movie 3 came out on Tuesday and I bought it right after school! It rocks my socks! I think like the funniest part is when Cindy and Brenda are talking in Brenda's classroom and all the sudden a box of crayons whams against the wall and Brenda says " Now who the f*** was that?!" Yeah sort of bad but idk the way she says it is really funny so me and my brother watch it over and over. lol Ahhh the breadstick is still staring at me! He's torturing me... please make it stop! Gina Grape is also staring at me but she isn't torturing me as much as Bene Breadstick is. Oh okay I guess there's also Ollie the Olive, Ricky Ravioli, and Tonya Tomato but the only one I noticed was Bene Breadtsick and now he won't leave me alone. I wish I could drive because then I would go drive up to Olive Garden and get me a breadstick. Haha I remembered this weird dream I had last night- I was at my grandma's house for some reason and I had to sing Cotton Eyed Joe in front of these judges at her house. Well I had searched and searched for the Cotton Eyed Joe music so that I could sing to it (I guess it never occured to me in my dream that I have it on a CD) but anyways I went around looking for it everywhere and I finally found a music video of Cotton Eyed Joe so I put it in and get ready to sing it for the judges but the music video turns out to be this old guy playing on a banjo singing this really weird messed up version of Cotton Eyed Joe and all the judges give me really weird looks and I start making up a really weird dance to it and start knee-slapping around the room. hehe lol oh what a messed up unconscious brain I have. We were thinking that Flinker's gonna assign us this huge assignment over the summer-like a review so we don't forget or something and then leave us her address or something or she'll some to our house and demand the review and when we don't have it she'll get her shaky mad voice and go all psycho on us. I really could imagine her doing that. Freaky. Okay doke type more some other time 5*18*04 *Tiff* HEY! everybody hows it going? I'm drinking mt.dew and it's 3:07 and I'm definitely not playing soccer right now isn't that awesome! DUDE it's so nice not having to go everyday anymore!

Britian looks better to me. Oh well. Looks aren't everything ;D lol. I'm on AIM and I'm actually on RexRocks72 man I haven't gotten on that for awhile now. Holy Toledo huh?! Yeah I know. I have too many screen names to count. Not really..but I can't really remember them all. 391-8384. ^^Shot down said you never had the chance took a ride on a suicide romance.^^ 5*22*04 I had a funny dream where yeah it was funny..hehehe. Al and me were going into Toys R Us and we went to the candy machine and I went and just pulled one and tons of candy came out so we went around and pulled them all and all this candy came out it was cool. Then yeah her grandma (but it wasn't actually either of her grandmas) told us that we couldn't have any candy and so like we decided to leave it around the store for little kids to find and be happy because they have candy.Okay then evenentually we left the store and it was all wet outside with lots of puddles and we were playing in the puddles. Then right by toys r us was some kind of really long race track all you could see was how it went off into the distance ya know. Then we got put into a race and it was like a tag team thing like yeah it was cool. There were 4 other teams and they all sucked. We had go carts and had to race them in one race and in a nother we had like these motorized scooters and you had a passenger on the scooter it was cool lol. Then whenever I finished the race I always was running instead of driving and I always flipped to get one of the flags and I'd get the high one but it would be the wrong flag because for some stupid reason each team had there own flag and I never got MY flags team....ugh...lol. Yeah thats the dream pretty much ...weeeeeird. 5*23*04 *Tiff Again* hehehehe LTE WOO LTE WOO LTE WOO!!!!!!!!!! Gotta get pumped up! WAAAHOOOO!!! I'm listening to yellowcard they're cool. They are.

OoOoOoOo so me and Josh were in the mall and we were sitting in a chair reading the Guiness Book of World Records and STUFF so then these 2 er..ladies...come and sit in the chairs like by us and yeah eventually one gets up and goes to the sexuality section and picks up a bunch of books about sex and they start laughing like little middle school kids about these sex books..lol. They like talk about positions and there husbands and stuff..ha it was funny! Like dude to get that position the girl would have to be 100 pounds and the guy's weiner would have to be 2 feet long! AH it was funny. *June 10th* *AL* Ayiyiyiyiyi so so so so so so so so so BORED! Nothing to do...... yesterday I had nothing to do.... today I have nothing to do- just BAYSITTING all day until 3:00 then come home and have nothing to do. Tiff and Josh are at the zoo and I'm stuck at home doing nothing. Bleah. Okay.. oh well enough complaining I will surely have SOMETHING to do tomorrow. hopefully.... yeah I'll call mis amigos and we could go to see The Day After Tomorrow or something.... hmmmmmmm. Sounds cool. AY!

I'm so bored that's the highlight of my day. LOL see ya'll later 7*3*04 *Tiff* HEY! Haven't written on here FOREVER. So how is everyone who doesn't come anymore because we never write? not that anyone ever came in the first place..I guess a couple but yeah pretty sure no one does now ..lol. SO Al is off to Arizona today and Josh is at some golf thing so that leaves me BORED. July is a busy month all of us are gonna be doing stuff. SO! summer has been fun so far, trying to think of stuff to do everyday is pretty hard you know since it's IOWA and all but we manage lol :D. Huong's bida is coming up and me and Al got her a present already (together). It looks really small but there are a couple of thingers in it..so yeah it isn't as tiny as it looks. Man I forgot how hard it is to type on this thing, it's hard coming up with stuff to ramble about. It's hardER now since it's summer and there isn't school, usually during school I can at least blab on about the Flinker or something and her evilness but nope because I haven't seen Flinker in a month! (YESS!!! PARTY!) It's raaaaaining out :D man I don't know what to do! I should play in the rain but don't really feel like doing anything because of my sunburn. DUDE I'm the hugest wuss, I can't stop whining and complaining about a stupid little sunburn ugh! I'm annoying myself so it probably annoys everyone else too. OOO I have to tell about Larry's bida party! His bida is like May 1st but we had the party like June 27th or something but yeah whatever anyway it was AWESOME! We made a cake that was supposed to be the shape of a bowling ball but kinda wasn't really it sorta was retarded lol, but still COOL, and it was extremely rich like extreme extreme like Al got sick from eating 1 piece and even Josh could only eat 1 piece. I didn't even finish my piece lol. We fed some of it to Larry lol, we got pictures. haaa it's sooo coool! :D :D :D Everyone probably thinks we're all retarded..heheheh :D. Then the next day we went bowling with Larry. Allison made him a blanket for his birthday...haaa awesome. It was lots of fun! Okay thats enough for today just updating everyone...=] 7*17*04 *Tiff* Hey everybody! again! I'm just typing on the LTE before I go downstairs to take a shower. Josh left for his camp thing last night, it sucks. Now me and Allison are here for like a week then we leave and will be gone for 10 days. In COLORADO! SO COOL! Tomorrow at church we find out the details, hopefully. lol. Were gonna be camping in the rocky mountains lol. Cool duuuder. I haven't typed on the LTE forever, I just keep updating my xanga lol. The poor LTE is like gone man.. I need to make LTE page 2. I think I'm gonna do that (maybe) after I take a shoer, if I feel like it. If you come on, however, and there is no LTE page 2! Then it means I didn't feel like making one. If there is then that is a suprise lol. So I guess we are all moving ya know? so my parientals lol told me that by time I get back we might be selling our house. So I have to take a bunch of pictures off the walls and I have to take all personal items down, which hugely sucks! RAR! I gotta pack everything up in boxes and the house we are supposedly gonna move into but not positive isn't gonna be done being built until the end of September! GAH! lol No personal stuff til September gosh darnit that sucks lol. Then I don't even get my room I have to wait until they build me a room. Rar. lol. Okay I'm gonna go take a shower then adios!7*17*04 *Tiff* Okey then! HOLA! Look like I made a page 2 after all. I wonder what Allison is doing right now. I am kinda bored, I think she is busy today though like her family wants her at home. Yeah, I don't know. I should call and ask. LaLaLa I'm trying to fill up the page! Yeah right! Not gonna work! Doo-Doo-Doo. Our iMoods have been the same mood forever!Maybe I should change mine. ha. Okay I'm gonna try to call Allison and yeah see what she's up to today. Okay gonna go, but I'm pretty bored so I might be back here later. Adiiiiiiiios! Okay nevermind. I called and she isn't home. Argh, now I'm bored..lol. 7*21*04 HALLO! HUM. We leave for Colorado in 2 days and yeah I have this big old bag full of stuff and I don't know what I'm gonna do because it's humongus and yeah how am I gonna get there. Oh my gosh. Allison is not contributing to the LTE, she is writing some story for some reason I think it's like to get back at Josh idk what it is, and yeah I am gonna read it when she is done then I can tell you all what it is about or maybe she can just tell you except no because she isn't going to contribute to the LTE, oh my gosh. lol. Lalala. I want to leave for Colorado nooooow! lalala! Oh my gosh. I am so bored, my house is so boring, there is nothing to do, oh my gosh. Lalala. 7*21*04 *AL* Hey I just got done writing my story. It's awesome. Tiff's reading it right now. It's a story about trolls. Well yeah I was just writing it for no reason mostly. but yeah I was sort of pretending to be mad at Josh cuz when I was in Arizona I sent him and Tiff a postcard but when he's away I didn't get a note blaaaaah. oh well I wasn't really mad anyways. I like never get mad. If I do it's not for real just sarcastic madness. I'm going crazy.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D YUM Tiff brought in some scrumptious bread! lalalalalaalal better go eat some. *Tiff* Hey guysssss I'm BORED. It's later, it's like 8-ishhh now. Al's gone. YIP YAP. Sooooo hum. lalala! I've been doing that a lot lately. Alright so I made the LTE part 2 isn't that cool? because I always try to go to our LTE (yeah right, now always, rarely) but anyway yeah and it never comes up because there is SOOO much to load and all ya know? yeah. It takes too long and it started to bug me so I decided instead of making it take longer each time by typing more and more that I'd just make a different page..nifty huh? :D :D :D Yep. I wonder if I already talked about this..lol. That'd be funny, I just repeat the same thing over because I can't think of anything else..hah. It tis hot my goosh gosh gosh. Well I packed today. For my tripper to Colorado. 10 days. I love Colorado. The trip is pretty strict though. They have 11 amendments lol. The ride there is gonna be really really boring too..ha. I can't wait to go to Colorado! I can't wait to get back either! lol I am looking forward to both! :D :D :D Alrighty then dudddderrss I'll MAYBE type tomorrow, idk, depends if I have time..lol, yeah right I'll have time, depends if I remember! Okey then chosters see ya laaattteeerrr! 7*22*04 *Tiff* Hey buddies! lol I'm back again. 11:23 am. Haven't eaten, or showered, or done anything except play on my computer of course, oh Josh called too and I talked to him for 2 minutes lol but yeah otherwise haven't done anything. So now I'm typing on the LTE page 2! because we needed one! I have nothing to type lol...tomorrow at this time I'll be on a long long long long boring ride to Colorado..and it's going to be very boring lol. Maybe I'll get to know some of the people that I'm going with, that would be good, since yeah I don't really know them, never really talked to them AND I have to spend 10 days with them. So yeah...should get to know someone. Sooo I actually have some stuff to do today! It's raining...hehehe isn't that cool? rain rain rain. Okay yeah I have to go to the bank and get mula for food and showers lol. I have to take the book and the notes to Josh's house that me and Al did/made/wrote. I NEED to take a shower tonight, kinda late, so it will last a few days because yeah showers cost $2.50! Holy cow! Yeah I know. I have to clean my room and put all the stuff away in like shelves and stuff, well not everything, just some stuff...I already took everything down. So just whatever is left..Yeah and I have to go buy 2 waterbottles lol to bring on the tripper. Then I have some extra stuff to pack too. Then I am gonna call Josh and talk to him because yeah it will be 10 days til I see him. So gonna talk to him a little bit. Then yeah I'm gonna hope that Allison can give me a ride because if she can't then I don't know how I am going to get to church...uhoh! Alright I should get something to eat. Thats enough rambling for now..eh? lol yeah alright I'll type later like maybe later today or maybe when I get back. Adios! 8*24*04 *Tiff* Heya Heya everybody I'm back again. School starts on the 30th...ahhhh!!! School is the gayest thing ever. Ommmmmygooosh I'm so bored. Josh is out golfing and Allison is in Illinois with her mom idk what for but yeah, so I have absolutely nothing to do today and it's so boring. If I had a posterboard then I could make a clue game but I don't. My parents can't drive me anywhere either because we don't have a car that can drive because it has a flat tire and so I'm stuuuck here!!!! noooooooo! Darnit. lol. Booooring Booooring just sitting here. So I decided to come back to the ever-famous LTE. We don't type on here much this summer, I type all the time on my xanga site instead.. HEY! Thats a pretty good idea, I could make a xanga out of the LTE, then everyone would know what went on everyday. DARNIT! I can't because I don't have the right dates...darnit! lol. Oh well...maybe we can make another LTE for this upcoming year except it can be on a xanga site because that would be easier but nah not really though because that wouldn't really be an LTE...man. All my ideas aren't working. I was going to go play clue at Allison's today except her brother couldn't play anyway so we wouldn't have been able to play. She made her clue game with Her, Angie, Chad, Josh and me in it as the people but yeah idk who the other one is because there is supposed to be E but oh well. Better without E anyway. I am going to make mine out of like Flinker and Weber because that will be funny. I don't know what other people to put in it...just know Flinker and Weber mwahahhaahhahahahahha! welp anyway I am gonna go on xanga now and I have nothing to do anyway so yeah guess I'll go on there and do absolutely nothing in my boredness ahhhh! lol 9*11*04 hey everybody... it's the third anniversiary of the Twin Towers fall down. I haven't heard anything about it so far though. I gotta go to my aunt Becky's wedding reception tonight. That should be fun. Man I haven't typed on here forver. I kinda lost interest. If we printed out our Lte page 1 it would be 75 pages long. pretty cool huh? well yeah I'm bored. lol adios 9*12*04 *Tiff* as you all should be aware, school has started up again, so the LTE! (AWEESOMENESS) lol I'm so retarded, but anyway should be back! except Allison is bored of it so it might be a solo trail for awhile ahead. Homecoming is this upcoming Friday, I'm going with Josh. (yay) and we're gonna have an awesome time. I am wearing Sara's awesome Mexican red dress thingy it's soooo cooooL! lol I'm excited! :D yay! Well anyway, need some more rambling to prolong the LTE even more. Gosh, the LTE is so classic. HM. New news? well, I've been going to Pine Street for abouta month now. Coolio, lol. ANNND... yep. 10*25*04 Heya guys. School has been obviously torturing us all, and idk why but I just decided to come here. It's a stupid Monday. School is retarted. I don't have much to say. So this is just going to be a short little entry thing. 12*15*04 *Tiff* Oh my Oh my! How I forgot the woundrous LTE!! How dare I?!?!?!?!? Thats just terrible. Well today I was in 2nd period, which is Mr.Wolf, which is Computer Graphics, and we went to the art show thing...and so we were in this computer room that is actually for "advanced computer graphics" blah...but we were there and on the computers and I kept trying to go to a bunch of websites but I couldn't! It was just crrraazzzyy! lol. heheheheheh. Anyway though all my websites were blocked but then! I remembered! Angelfire isn't blocked! So I got on there and then I couldn't even remember the password to hermnerp, man I still got to find it...but anyway..yeah..whatever..I wanted to write on the LTE really bad because it's been a super long time, but I couldn't so now I have JUST gotten home from school and I am writing on the LTE. Isn't that wonderful? I think so too. Well whats going on in my life? I don't know...everything is pretty fine and dandy I guess. Winter break is in like a week...YAY. So I am excited for that! Ummm..I'n kinda feeling for some food right now. I almost don't want to go to Pine Street because there is going to be a cookie eating contest, I hate eating contests..ew..make me want to puke. So I'm not going to do it. BlAHH. I don't even want to watch it. Hopefully the cookie thing is BEFORE 7:45 and then after it there will just be a nice normal thing like every Wednesday...I hope so. The food fight thing would have been fun though! Weeeee. I got my Christmas Cards! and I sent Tina her Christmas card too! I just realized how bad I got at babbling. My LTE is like down in the gutter because I haven't been updating it...and well Allison hasn't been on it for like a year..lol. I think I got on it at least..once..during summer. Oh yeah and the LTE2 I got rid of because the point of the LTE is to be all on one page, so yeah the second page was just messing it up...so I had to fix that. Now it's all on one page 217k. We haven't been bowling in forever. It's so funny how everything is named Larry now, all after Larry the wiffleball from that one day of gym..way back in 8th grade. 8th grade, ahh those were the days. I decided that Mrs.Mckay was really cool, probably one of my favorite teachers...she was neat, and nice. I have gotta keep going! practice by blabbing. I have a xanga now. I've had once since May. It's pretty close to the same thing as this, except just a titty bit different... hehehehehehehehh. Oh well... So Tina moved to California! I didn't update on that...um...yeah. We'll just have to wait and see if I type on the LTE again, or if it ends up being a one-time-thing..where it'll be like 2-3 months before you hear from me again..ooooo mysterious!!! eat.your.heart.out. :P hheheheheehe. I'm back already! Hah! It's been like 2 minutes or something! Hah! I'm so crazy! hah! Okay whats up again everyone. Everything is good over here and stuff. Lets see Lets see. Oh yeah man I never even told you all that we go to pine street I don't think geez what kind of crappy informer person am I anyway? Pretty darn CRAPPY! Whooooo's yooour dddaaaaaaaadddddddyyy!!! Who's your baby, who's your buddy, who's your maaaaan!! lol don't comment on that guys, it's a song that none of you will know, just me becaues I'm a loser. Hey guys I had 2 planerians Pablo and Bartholomeu, I like Bartholomeu spelled like that more then like Bartholomew...so just...spell it my way..lol. Then guess what? they died, and I was sad, seriuosly, I almost was crying about having to cut them in half, even ask Josh! He was there..I was breaking down over some planerians and they're like teeny tiny. We dissected a bunch of stuff in that class. <>. Like, a squid, a clam, starfish, earthworm, ascaris...none of you know what an ascaris is, it's a worm, except without segments..lol...it's really not all that great..lol. Earthworms are cooler. They should have named it buttpoop instead of ascaris, because it is a buttpoop. Actually I don't hate them that much, I just over exaggerated, I always do that. lol. I said I ALWAYS do that, and when I said that, I was overexaggerating again. Ha.Ha.Ha. You know I'm spending my time typing this when I already have a different paper that I'm supposed to be typing. Kinda..dumb...isn't it. My poor typing fingers are going to be so tired! Gosh! lol. Allison's tradition-annual Christmas Party is this Friday and I'm PuMpEd!!! booyaaa! sHIZ bIZ..lOl. hahaha Josh says that a lot. I bought Josh a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers shirt for Christmas. John said it was b/a...I hate when people say b/a. like they actually say B.A. though...it's like man man if you're gonna do that then you might as well have just said it....shut up. Oh you know whats even WORSE!!?!!?!??!? When people say J/K. but they SAY J.K. oh my gosh don't ever do that or I'll eat youuuuuur eyeball out of it's socket then puke it up into your shoe then you'll step into it BAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAHA! seriously though, actually don't ever do EITHER of those...EVER. heh. "Well have a good day everyone, I'm going to type my paper! Bye! :D 8*17*06 *Tiff& Does this thing still work? GUESS WHO IS BACK! It's me!!! HA! Dang it has been a stinkin' long time since I have been on this thing. I can't believe that we gave up on the famous LTE. All of that junk mail from our fans is piling up in our mailbox... wondering why it has been 2 years since we have been on? It was just a long lunch break guys, but the dynamic duo is back in action..ready to please. So what has been going on I know you are wondering? WELL.. NOT MUCH at all! It's Senior Year now! Which sucks. Allison and I still suck at life! We have a couple new friends, lots more enemies.. you know, life is life. We work at a racist..sexist.. ice cream store! I just drank a strawberry soda and went glow disc golfing. I am not as good at rambling as I used to be, because it is hard for me to think of something to say on this right now...it has been so long too, and I still can't think of what pointless thing to say? UHHH... I don't know..this is hard. School is about to start, sucks, Flinker retired... DID YOU KNOW~!?!?!?!? I kNOW!!!! She did last year.. it is crazy! As sad as it sounds, I miss the Flinker. She wasn't so bad...esp after Scovil almost failed me in precalc. lol. That's a good story, if you like me enough, you should ask me to tell it.... UMMMMM blah blah blah. bye guyses. 5*21*07 *TIFF* BoO! 7*14*07 *AL* Hey guys!! It's good to be back. This thing has so many good memories stored on it. Tiffany and I graduated! It's crazy. She's going to St. Ambrose and I'm going to UNI but I know we'll still be going strong all through college. Don't worry, loyal readers, we will keep this thing up for years to come. lol until next time...adios 10*1*07 *AL* Oh my goodness, when I read this thing, it makes me want to cry. It makes me so happy. The years documented on this LTE were the absolute best years of my life. Tiffany, Josh, and Allison. We had so much fun... as you can see from reading this awesome website. We did so many crazy things... dead frogs, sewers, watermelon fights, farting mud, cliff jumping, Maquoketa Caves, the drive-in, Social Circles, the dance channel, garage sales, 5 Points, the train tracks, Farm Flakes, Tae Bo, the Sacred Mountain Dew, Ze Hammer, Larry the bowling ball... it makes me overwhelmingly happy to think of those years of my life. We didn't have a care in the world, and we just hung out everyday and loved each other to no end. We didn't have to worry about jobs or college or any of that. I would give anything to go back. I miss doing random things and acting like little kids. I miss having only enough money to buy one Choco Taco to split bewteen two people. I miss having to walk everywhere because we couldn't drive. I miss going to Pine Street High every Wednesday night. I miss going to the drive-in with Jody and Brian. I miss having garage sales and being psyched that we made $80!!! I miss it all. Why do we have to grow up? Getting older just really isn't any fun at all. Not as fun as these years of my life. I am so glad we are all still friends because I don't know what I would do without some piece of this part of my life. I love them both. Josh and I don't talk that much anymore, but when we all hang out, it's still so much. Tiffany- I love her so much, and I know we'll be friends always. We're already making plans for her wedding.. I'm pretty excited to plan some kickin' parties. haha I can imagine the three of us... maybe four if my husband is cool... but we are all sitting together when we're like 90 and laughing about all the good times we had when we were kids. Maybe we'll get out Social Circles to play or maybe turn on the Dance Channel and dance our hearts out. All you need in this life are true friends. I'm so glad I found them when I did because they made my life so unbelievably memorable. I wouldn't trade that part of my life for anything. We'll try to keep up this website, so all of you, our dedicated readers (haha) can know how things pan out for us throughout our lives. I can tell you with no doubt, that anytime you check back, we will still be great friends. :)11*17*09 *TIFF* Hey there amigos! I thought I'd do an update on our lives now! Hahaha. SOOO. Allison and I are roommates up at UNI, we're both juniors. I'm going to be a spanish teacher and she is a spanish major and she just switched from teaching so she has got her own stuff going on but all she really wantsta do is open a Mexican restaurant or a pet shop or something. Anyway! As you can see we haven't changed very much! I see Josh a lot lately, he is thinking he is going to go into the Air Force this spring and I'm pretty sad about it but I try to be a good support! I don't know how I used to type so much on this thing I am having a hard time thinking of stuff right now and it has been years since I've talked to you! I have been teaching at a school and it's pretty weird cause it wasn't that long ago that I was in high school! Some of the kids remind me of me and my friends. It's pretty funny, sometimes I hate it, but I hope it turns out for the best because I've already put a lot of time and effort and MONEY into it so I don't want to turn back now! haha. Anyway we're all healthy and sane as ever</p>
        <p>on the Very Weird Stuff link to see more, or click on the music link? We have halloween and christmas pictures on the NeoPics link. Cheese is not a wild thing!!!!!!!!! Now I have decided to go for a world record. I will try to make the longest web page ever, made completely out of text! Won't that be fun? I will just type, and type, and never, ever use copy and paste. Wow...I really must be bored. Just goes to show what boredom can do to you. Any way, that's it for now. Wait, no it isn't, I still have to keep going, and going, and going. Because I do. THE REST OF THE STUFF I TYPE WILL BE COMPLETLY IN CAPS JUST BECAUSE I CAN. THAT IS ALL. SEEYA! Hi, I'm back. So far this is nowhere near the world record. I think. I don't exactly know where it is...oh, well. I'll just have to do the very best that I can. No one is really coming here, anyway. So it doesn't matter. By the way, TAB is a worthwhile, community-service organization. The form link is to a 100% fake TAB registration form that you can fill out just for laughs. I can't believe I'm bothering to do this. I have very low expectations of my site. None ever comes here, I could do this all day long and I still wouldn't have any more hits. This is just a pointless excursive in spelling errors and grammatical imprecision. May your day be shiney! The following is an extremely weird poem-thingy that I wrote when I was in a relatively weird mood:
        never mind that noise my dear can anyone pass the cheese only if you say pretty please oh, boy do I have to sneeze. why must everyone always rhyme, why I’m a poet and don’t I know it? what I fear comes right after here not this life or the next will I ever be able to pass the test? we’re stuck in here, (alone my dear) and we’ll problem never get out so don’t start to shout. it’s dark and I want to go home is where the heart was where is it now? we’ll never know but oh crap it’s starting to snow and it’s time to show and tell about the well that you found last summer at camp when it was damp it was near the ramp oh god why must this be I liked that tree but now it’s gone, farewell so long I’ll miss you as long as you write but then I’m afraid to say good-night. my dear there’s nothing to fear that’s only a box that’s made of blocks next to the wagon that looks like a dragon why are you shaking it’s your fear that is making you shiver and act all a quiver. don’t you know that you only need be afraid of fear and never anything here and certainly not a post that acts like a ghost?
        See, very weird. At least it fills up my word quota for the day. Not that I exactly have a word quota for the day. It just sounded very professional to say it. Anyway, I still don't think that anyone is actually coming here. You'd have to be an absolute loser (or really bored) to come here. I'd probley come here, but that isn't much of a surprise. After all, I've been to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website over 50 times. Pathetic. But, whatever. As long as I'm happy, right. Humor the crazy person, okay? Oh, guess what? According to someone you problem don't know, this is the second most pointless website ever! Next to the Really Big Button, of course. I feel special. Come on everyone, group hug. Okay, now I'm starting to scare myself...I'm gonna quit for today. Seeya. Now I'm back. Is this getting confusing to you? Too bad. Now I want you to go to http://quiz.ravenblack.net/blood.pl?biter=eon" If you do this I'll get points in the game. Come on all you non-existing people! Help me! You know you want to! It's a worthy cause! Honestly, the more time I waste playing the game, the less time I'll work on this site and the less stuff you gotta read. Although why you'd be here if you didn't want to read is beyond me. Maybe you're lost. Okay, if you want to get out, click the little refresh button, okay? Good...what? You say it didn't let you out? Oh, well. You must be caught in a time warp. Keep pressing it. Maybe you'll break free. What's that. The little counter at the bottom keeps going up? Never mind. That's just how many times you have to click before you can leave. Good-bye.

        Hey, I'm once again: back. I don't suppose you fell for that little thing about the refresh button. After all, you're a responsible, intelligent person who apparently has a lot of time on your hands. Well, you can't possibly have more time than I do. I mean, after all, I made this site. You're only browsing it. And most people don't even come here. Not even my friends...*sniffle* The just ignore this poor, pathetic little page. All they do is fill out the TAB form and leave. I think. Maybe they're here right now! HI! HOW ARE YOU DOING? I'M FINE! THANKS FOR COMING! YES, I'M YELLING! Who am I kidding. This page won't get a single hit, unless I bribe people...now that has possibilities. Okay, fill out the TAB form, so I have proof that you bothered to come here and...uh...I'll...uh...send you a sandwich? Please allow 6-8 weeks for delivery. I'm bored. I'm gonna go hug a moose. MOOSE! I love-d you moose! Hey, I'm back again! Yea...*waits for applause* okay! Now I want all you loyal fans...*cricket chirps* to go to the link to see what I'm like. I took a whole bunch of personality quizzes and posted them there. I'm an evil villain, kitty and a freakazoid so far. And I only took the quiz once, too. Spooky how accurate they are...anyway, I command you to go! I'm going. I'm back. I'm gonna start counting how many times I say back. Let's see: 1...2...3...4...5! Wow. I must really be desperate for something to do. I now officially have proof that someone has been here! It was one of my friends. Apparently this page really is getting long, because my friend said something to that effect. Maybe. Anyway, moving on! I'm just basically typing nothing. Just like all those reports people have to do. You know? With a specific number of words. They start out with half that number, and then just fill in words until they have the right amount. I salute those people. You're great tradition is being carried out here, on the second most pointless site ever! Well. Maybe eventually some weird, bored person will wander onto my site on accident and be mildly entertained be my site until they wander onto a live video feed of a coffee maker. Or maybe not. I only know that I'm entertaining me, which was my original goal. So. I've done what I've set out to accomplish. Yea, me! I'm so special. You see, most people, they don't like reading or writing. So if you're not most people, you've made it down this far without skipping, skimming or getting the spark notes version. (Which I think does not exist) My point is, if you've bothered to read this, then, (like me) you probley have also read the ketchup bottle so many times that you have it down verbatim. Look verbatim up. It's a word. But, you should know that, since you like reading. Or maybe you're just skimming. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with reading food labels. You might be asked a question about them on a quiz show. And now, for the million-dollar question: How many calories are there in a single serving of Mustard? I can just see it now...It could be called Know-Your-Food. Or You are What you Eat. It'd probley be as popular as those game shows that no one's ever heard of. Speaking of food, what's up with pie? There's strawberry pie, apple, pumpkin and so many others, but there is no grape pie! I know. I'm just as upset about this unfortunate lack of development in the pie division. Think about it. Grapes are used to make jelly, jam, juice and raisins. What makes them undesirable for pie? Would they dry into raisins? Couldn't you just stick some jelly in a piecrust and bake it? It just doesn't make any sense. Another thing that bothers me is organ grinders. You know, the foreign guys with the bellhop hats and the little music thingy and the cute little monkey with the bellhop hat who collects the money? Okay. They're basically begging on the street. How did they ever afford an organ-thingy? Wouldn't it make more sense to get a kazoo, if you're broke? And if they're so poor, what possessed them to buy a monkey? I mean, I don't think I could afford a monkey, and I'm not exactly on the streets. Obviously I at least have a computer...so, back to the organ grinders. I would have sold the monkey and the organ and been able to eat for at least a year. Or, if I was weirder than I am, I could at least kill the monkey with the organ and eat it. Why on earth did they keep the monkey? It must have cost a fortune to feed...not to mention the mess. That's just one of those many facts of life that are better left mysteries. Especially since no one but me would ask the question. I better go. I think I hear a monkey...Okay...now I'm back. That's the sixth time I've said back! I realize that this longest text ever must be very boring and not worth anyone's time. But I'd like to take this time to thank the 2 and 1/2 people in the entire universe who have bothered to read this entire thing. I'm not exactly sure who they are, but: thanks! Right now, my spacebar is malfunctioning...that's not good...I have to press it two or three times just to insert a freaking space. Maybe the evil little faeries with the sharp little teeth have put their evil faerie dust on my computer. Or maybe not. This is too frustrating. Goodbye for now...Now I'm back. And still frustrated. But for a different reason. Today I had the misfortune of playing a Treasure Planet game on neopets.com It was terrible. Apparently the point of the game was to get your character to shout "Whoo-Hoo!" as many times as possible before you splattered your brains on the rocks, all the while listening to a soundtrack that is similar to a dying ceiling fan. Of course, when I started out I accidentally hit the rocks approximately three million times. Halfway though I used my four remaining brain-cells to decide that the game was dumb. So my goal changed from surviving to laughing evilly while my character died. So the game naturally did everything it could to preserve my life. The stupid game is still going on and I refuse to quit because I want my points. My character is actually dodging the stupid rocks better now then when I controlled him. I hate irony. Seeya. Okay. Now I'm back again. Today I added an update page, which is basically a less chaotic, outlined version of this without all the ranting. It's more like techno talk about arrays and how much I suck and whether or not the Braves will win this year. Okay, the whole braves thing is made up. But everything else I've said so far is true. I think. Maybe I should start on a boring disclaimer...Eh-hem. All contents of this site were designed for entertainment purposes only. Any use thereof that is not stated in the above mentioned statement would make the author, hereby referred to as Patron Saint of Paper Clips, very angry. Should you violate the purpose of this site: i.e. become not entertained, the Patron Saint of Paper Clips will be forced to take drastic measures. This is specified in Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook. Ooooo…that’s a great idea! I’m gonna start quoting from the Flaming Chicken Handbook! Code: 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (that’s me) is allowed to cause vague, pain like sensations while the offending person (or alien life form, dog, etc.) isn’t paying attention. Now I have a purpose in life! To make up quotes from the non-existent Flaming Chicken Handbook, which I’m sure you have a copy of. No? Too bad. It’s in the mail, I promise! Now I must take my leave…and remember. Cheese is watching. Okay...I'm back...I think that eventually half of this thing will consist of the word back over and over again...that's just weird. Which fits the motif of the rest of the site. There's even a money back guarantee. Isn’t' that nice? See? Now no one can ever say that I don't take care of my viewers. Especially since I don't have viewers. I have readers. Wait...I really don't even know if anyone bothers to read this. Even if I put it in a less chaotic, more user-friendly format people would still ignore this because it involves: reading. Yes. Sad to admit, but the majority of people would rather read the summary at the back of a book rather than the whole book itself. What has the world come to? It's pathetic. Especially since I'm bothering to write all this. It's not fair! Why can't I have more readers?! All the other internet writers have nothing on me, except they're better at advertising, having a central theme/plot and basically more talented. Whereas I'm more into the whole ranting and raving stage right now. Plus, I am horrible at spelling. Which is bad. Thank the powers that be for spell-check. The single greatest invention of the computer gods. I'm getting bored, so I think I'm done for the day. May your day be shiney! I'm back again! And I feel weird! I found at that yet another one of my friends is reading this. Creepy. Just how much time do they have on their hands. Perhaps their just trying to be nice. I can just see it now...an organization devoted not to feeding the hungry, or peace, or love or whatever, but to giving recognition to all those poor, pathetic, unpopular websites. I wonder what it's name would be. Don't Ignore Sites? Would it be called DIS? Isn't that like a slang term for an insult? Would that be considered poetic justice, or just a nice coincidence? And why do I even care? I'll tell you why. Because I have nothing else to do right now. I could be playing neopets, but ever since my bad experience with Treasure Planet, I don't feel like it. Oh, by the way, I noticed that whenever I use spell-check, my stupid computer turns the word probley into to word problem. To prevent this, I did nothing. So, it is now up to you, the imaginary reader, to decide whether I mean probley or problem...it's almost like a game! But without the bad sound track. And I promise not to force you to live when you would rather die. Moving on, I have nothing else to say, but don't feel like quitting just yet. I'm like the little engine that could. Or maybe the Energizer Bunny. I just keep going, and going and going. Or I could be like that annoying guy on T.V. who keeps asking if you can hear him. If my site manages to last a decade, my readers *snicker* will probley wonder what I'm talking about. My answer is simple. It doesn't matter. I'm just rambling. Which means that it doesn't matter if you understand anything I say. Doesn't that make you feel better? I bet it does. Wow. Look how long this has gotten. I even impress myself. Who would have thought I have this much free time? And I congratulate any reader who has gotten this far. Ooooooo! You must check out the fortunes section of the random stuff page! I've just gotten an idea for some more, original, fortunes...I gotta go!(may the moose be with you) And now I am back. I swear. If iI fill out the fake tab form I'm gonna have to put back as my favorite word...I already have filled it out, though. Would it be cheating to fill it out again? Only if I had multiple personalities. Or would it be cheating if I didn't have multiple personalities? The world may never know. Just like how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop. Would it vary? The number of licks, I mean. Someone could have super-disolving spit, or watery-spit. Or what if you took big ol' slobbery licks? Does the commercial take that into account? No. It doesn't. And let me tell you, it's an outrage. It deludes all of American's sweet, innocent, candy-loving children into thinking that a cartoon owl is smarter than they are! "Mr. Owl, can you tell us how many licks does it take to get to the bottom of a tootsie pop?" Or whatever. And "Mr. Owl" replies "One...Twoo...Three! Chomp" And he bites it. That teaches our youth that it's okay to agree to help someone, and then ruin their experiment. Well...it's not. I am going to start a protest group. Teens Against Cartoon Owls. We could call ourselves TACO! I love the little tacos, I love them good! That is a direct quote from GIR, co-star and comic-relief on INVADER ZIM. Hmmmm...intersting. I put hyphens in both of his titles...it must be a conspiracy! I gotta go. Those TACO buttons don't make themselves, you know. I'm back again. And not so cheesed off about the whole tootsie roll pop thing. Right now, I have another twenty minutes on the Internet before I'm gonna watch T.V. And I can't think of anything else to do. So, predictably, here I am. It's not like I have anything better to do. Obviously, you know this. After all, look how long this text is. I wonder if I've made the world record? If I did, would I stop this? Why bother asking? I'll will most likely still be adding to this on my death bed. Hmmmmm...has any old, senile person ever written anything? Was it coherent? Did it make more sense that this text? Is it possible to make less sense? Am I enjoying asking retorical questions? Yes. Yes, I am. But I seriously wonder what something written by a senile person would be like. I've heard of poems and stuff written by people who were high, insane or paranoid. But never senile. Can a senile person write? Aren't they regressed to a child-like state? Does it even matter? Is anyone even reading this? Did I resume asking retorical questions? Do you care? Is this eating up time? I feel like I'm playing questions only on whose line is it anway. I probley should have capitalized something, or underlined but I'm feeling lazy...hey, you try to keep your two and a half readers happy! It's really stressfull. Someday, I'm gonna snap and just delete this entire thing. Gee, I hope not! I worked sorta hard on this. It's great for making random topics weave together to form an overall infrastructure of chaos. That made little sense. That's why it's here, and not some critically acclaimed site. Ooooooooooooo! I'm gonna quote from the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK again! Yep! I bet you were just breathless in anticipation. Okay. Here goes. Code: 472 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that this site in no way aknowledges the existance of other, better sites (hereon reffered to as the Losers) The Losers are a myth. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips (me again!) claims no knowledge as to where that particullary nasty rumor started, but confirms that this is the best site ever. It would be a sin against humanity for a better site to exist. Should you refuse to aknowledge the Patron Saint of Paper Clips as the ruler of the Internet, you will be subjected to punishment as stated in Code 343 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook (i.e. Experience vague, pain-like sensations when you're not paying attention) This has been a public service announcement. This is a test, I repeat only a test. Had this been an actual emergency, we would have bought up all the can openers and charged 3 cows and a pig for each one. I repeat, lock all you doors and windows, this is it. I repeat, there is nothing to worry about. Everything is fine. The end is not here. I'm going, you're on you're own! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm back!*smiles brightly* And apparantly delusional! Anyway, I just finished rereading my longest text ever. And I became inspired to talk about nothing. You see, I periodically read the longest text ever to check the constant downward spiral of my sanity. Hmmm...I seem to be entertaining myself though, even while reading what I wrote. Which is why I still go to the Really Really Big Button That Doesn't Do Anything website. Because I am easily amused and have lots and lots of time on my hands. Maybe, some day far in the future (like next Thursday) I'll print a copy of this insane text. And then go door to door distributing it. Eventually, this would become a monthly tradition. Whole families would gather around their front door, in breathless anticipation while they attempted to barracade me out. I can just see the whole community rising to thwart my attempts to spread love, joy and insane chaos. I probley wouldn't actually print this out (think how much paper it would take!) but if I do, only friends and enemies will receive copies. Hmmmm...maybe my condition is worsening. Or not. I'm still peeved about the cartoon owl from the Tootsie Roll Pop commercials. He is pure evil. TACO will eventually destroy him. Unless he has already been destroyed by an even more radical Anti-Cartoon-Owl group. I hope not. Or, would that be good? I suppose I could let someone else have the glory. After all, I'm not in this line of buisness for the fame, fortune and power. What line of buisness, do you ask? Why, the assasinating annoying cartoon characters buisness. (Actually I just question them untill they spontaneously combust, I ask lots of questions) So, in conclusion, ladies and gentleman of the jury(that's you) I could not have possibly tortured "Mr. Owl" to death. I love owls. Hmm...I seem to be jumping from one subject to another more frequently. Either I am growing more comfortable with my on-line writing, or I am progressivly getting more insane and chaotic. I also am psyco-analyzing myself a lot today...hmmmm...I'm even saying "hmmmmm..." a lot. Just like a real psychologist. Hmmmmmmm. Time for another boring disclaimer!!!!!!! Code: 742 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that in no part does the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (That's still me!) actually claim to be mentally ill. That's either a) a publicity stunt b) An attempt at humor c) a cry for help or d) none of the above You can e-mail your responses by conducting a scavenger hunt of this site. Some of the pages of this site contain a link encouging the two and a half people to e-mail the Patron Saint of Paper Clips. There may also be evil little links that are designed to confuse you. These links send stuff to someone named johnjones333@hotmail.com The Patron Saint of Paper Clips does not know who this individual is, but sincerly wishes that you send all your hate mail to him. Not that the aformentioned individual claims to have received hate mail (or mail of any kind) via a website link. Thank-you for your time. Remember to send your answers to my sanity quiz to the e-mail account, flamingchickens333@hotmail.com Oh, and once I refer to myself in the first person again, the handbook quote is over. I just thought that I might like to mention that. Oh. You're still here. I figured you rush right on over to e-mail me. Perhaps you don't have time to waste e-mailing me. HA! HA! HA! That's funny!!!! If you you don't have time to waste, what are you doing here?!!! Oh, who am I kidding. I figure that even the people I manage to lure onto my site from neopets don't even bother to come to this particular page. Maybe I should make the link come here directly...Hey! What a good idea! That way I can spread my love, joy and insane chaos to more people! I'm a genius. Gotta go, must lure innocent victems to the second most pointless site ever!!!! I'm back. And really angry, and confused. I've always known that I was weird, that's always been a given. But now I realize that I am considerably more normal than the rest of my family. Today we had a "family outing." Now, most families will go bowling, or putt-putt golfing. They may go to a resteraunt with an arcarde, or the movies or to a theme park. Not my family! No, we got the greatest family outing of all. We got to go to a bar and play pool!!!!!*waits for readers to become insanely jealous* Yep, that's right, a bar with a pool table! Not only did we get world class cuisine (under-cooked hotdogs and over-cooked hamburgers), my little sister (age 10) got taught pool by someone I strongly supect is an ex-convict! Naturally when it was announced that we'd be eating dinner in this place, I could hardly contain my excitment(I glared at my mother and asked why we couldn't go to Pizza Hut) When we arrived, we were promptly served (after thirty minutes) In the meantime, we played a family game of pool(my parents played while my brother and sister and I watched) After two rousing rounds, our food came. The food was superb, (our food came the exact opposite of how we ordered it, and half of the onion rings were missing) Then we joyfully returned to our game(my sister and the ex-con played my mom) We spent hours there (from 5p.m.-7:15p.m.) There were many people that were the same age as me and my siblings (no one in the room but us were under 30) Us kids had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the bar ( I almost fell asleep during the last game I watched) As we left, there was a feeling of goodwill and fellowship between all(my sister locked me out of the car and wouldn't let me in untill I started yelling profanity in her general direction) The high point of the entire night was when my mother gave me $21 for my report card. She promptly borrowed $1 to help with the waitresses tip(This part I'm not being sarcastic about) All in all it was a night I'll remember forever (as the lowest point in "family outing"history, except for that time my mom dragged me to a church thing on the concept of truth.) My brother(age 13) even decided upon a new job he wants when he's old enough to work, a busboy at the bar. We had to tell him that he would probley have to wait untill he was 21.(Absolutly nothing about that statement was sarcastic) As you can see, I love my families outings(Not unless you're blind...or stupid) &#!#%&&!!!(*%$ WHAT THE %$#@ WAS MY MOTHER $#$#%$# THINKING!!!!!!!???? BRINGING $#$$# KIDS IN A BAR!? I know it was her idea, 'cause my dad hates it, too. My mom and my stupid little 10-year old sister loves it, though. *sighs* Why does my life have to be so weird? I'm leaving...now I'm back! And not so pissed at my weird family. Now is the time to mourn the loss of one of my most loyal readers (I think she's read the entire thing one time, which is more than anyone else has done so far) She has been banned from accesing any portion of the Internet, do to reasons that must remain confidental due to security reasons. If I told you, I'd have to kill you and all that stuff. So...now I am down to one and a half readers. Untill such time that I have more. I wonder why anyone would read this? You would have to have several characteristics that I possess. First of all, you'd have to have an extrodinary amount of free time. Second of all, you would have to have the patience to read through all of this. And lastly, you'd have to know where the heck this site is. I admit it. I haven't exactly advertised this site. Nor can I find it on any search engines. Some of my pages have stuff written in to make search engines recognize me, but it doesn't seem to be working. What must I do to rise above obscurity? I tell people I know about this site, but they either ignore this page, or don't even bother coming to the site in the first place. I suppose that is the bane of all authors. To pour your heart and soul into a passage, and have everyone ignore it. *sniffle* Why must this be? Maybe I should just give up. After all, no one would really care if I quit updating this site. But I can't help but think of stuff like the evil over lord list and REALLY REALLY BIG BUTTON THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. They are not great neccesarily because of the content, (although that helps some) they are great because of their sheer length. You can read a little each day. And almost never finish. Also, I guess I still am trying to get the world record. I have heard some feedback suggesting that I make someway for people to remember where they stopped reading. It can be very confusing, especially if you weren't paying attention in the first place. Well, I dont want to organize this page, in any manner. This is chaos. And insanity. Not neat little text in classifiable rows, in alphabetical order. If you want neat, go to some other site(though, as mentioned in Flaming Chickens Code:472 there is no such thing as a site better than this one). Otherwise, I guess you're stuck with me. Awwwww...I'm touched! You didn't run screaming to another site, thankfull for the chance to escape this insanity. You're still here, which must mean that you'd rather be here than anywhere else! Hey, where are you going?! I thought you were gonna stay here and keep me company?! *drags reader back* See, I knew you'd stay! *gagged reader glares* What's that? I know this is the best site ever, thanks for the compliment! *reader starts inching towards freedom* I better go...I think that I may have a problem brewing. I'm back. And very concerned about this new, younger generation (all 10 year olds who were born in 1992) They are supposed to be the future. Instead they appear to be a nuclear armagedon in the form of a fifth grader. I chanced to have an interview with an informant from this evil generation (my little sister) who will be called Mrs. X for security reasons (no, she's not married, the "Mrs" makes it good as a disguise) I was quizing Mrs. X on Civil War History for an upcoming test in her classroom (whose location can not be devulged) Mrs. X seemed fluent in the subject. Using prior knowledge, I deduced that Mrs. X was full of crap. Out of sheer curiosity, I asked Mrs. X who participated in the Civil War. She immediatly replied "Clara Barton". I clarified, which countries fought in the Civil War. She answered: England, Russia, and (out of sheer desperation) Iraq. I believe that she was just listing countries she knows America has fought against. Now, correct me if I'm wrong...but Iraq? I don't know if Iraq even existed in the Civil War Era! Why on earth would we go have way across the world to fight them when we didn't even really need oil?!! Moving on, I finaly managed to coax my sister (I'm tired of writing Mrs. X) to tentativly guess that America fought in the Civil War. I mean, who'd a thought? America? Fighting in the American Civil War? In a moment of inspiration, I asked her who America fought. Her first guess was enslaved africans. Well, at least she knows that slaves were involved in the war. Before she could start listing all of America's enemies, I gave her a hint. I said "The Union fought..." With a crack, snaple and pop, some random synapses in her brain connected in the right order and she said "CONFEDERACY!!!" I was very proud of her, just as you would be proud of a two-year-old who has just announced: "I WENT POO-POO ON THE POTTY!!!!!" What I mean is, you wouldn't be very proud if the average person said that they just took a dookey on the toilet, and you wouldn't be very proud if they knew who fought against the Union in the Civil War. I confirmed that the Union was Northern and Free, and that the Confederacy was Southern and Slave. We resumed quizzing and she got every question on the worksheet correct. This is because she memorizes the questions. That way, she can pass the test without actually learning anything. You see, if you memorize stuff, you only have to remember that the answer to number 6 is Clara Barton for a week, rather than having to remember that Clara Barton started the Red Cross for the rest of you life. I sincerely appologize if anyone is offended by my view of memorization. I also would like such persons to immediatly leave my site. You don't belong here. You see...knowledge is good. If my sister...uh...Mrs. X were ever asked a question on the Civil War on a quiz show, she'd come up with nothing. With knowledge you can win money and the opportunity to look like a dork on national television. My sister is a big believer in the memorization system. I previous time when I was studying with her (American Revolution, this time) I was trying to help her remember the difference between the Patriots(Patriotic to America) and the Loyalists (Loyal to Britain) She didn't know what the word patriotic meant. I tried to explain. I asked her how you dress on the forth of july (she said nice) I asked what the colors red, white and blue were (pretty). I gave up in exasperation. More recently, I was trying to instill a sense of empathy and niceness in her. I asked her what the golden rule of christianity was. She didn't know. When I pressed her, she confessed she didn't know what chrisianity was. Completly defeated, I told her that it was the religion she practiced every Sunday when she went with her friends to church. This confirmed my suspicion that she only went so that she could have the use of the church's playground equipment. My family also strongly suspects that she stole $20 from the donation thingy. Anyway, that's my rant on the new generation that contains my little sister. When someone of her generation runs for president, I'm gonna do a complete background check. If they're anything like my sister, I'm movin' to Canada. Gotta go...the Russian-Brittish-Iraqi-enslaved-Africans are coming to defeat the Mexicans. I'm back! *there's that darn cricket again* And I have a genuine question to ask all of my loyal readers *cough-cough* Okay, here it is: Is it normal for a non-gender specific sibling to carry around various dead reptiles (snakes, turtles, lizards etc.) Furthormore, is it considered accepted behavior to talk to these dead reptiles, in a cooey, baby talky kind of voice? Finnaly, is it expected for said sibling's non-gender specific parent to encourage such behavior, citing "I was just like that as a child" as an excuse? It's an honest question as I fear that my non-gender specific sibling is weird. Who am I kidding? My entire family is weird. It's just a matter of degree. Hey, by the way. I'm sorry that my last few entries have been only about my various family antics. Although I can't see why you care, because there is a large probability that you do not exist, because I don't think anyone is reading this anymore. How discouraging. People need to make the time to waste time. It's a time honored tradition. Who'd thought that I could use time that many times in only a few sentences? It's been pretty quiet here lately, which is why I haven't added anything to this text in awhile. I know, you were just crushed that nothing new was happening. It's a sad, cold, cruel world out there and you had nothing to relieve the monotony of it. *sniffle* I feel so sorry for you! Next thing you know, you're internet connection will die. Well, too bad! Do you know I never even had a computer untill just a few months ago (that's why I'm obsessivly writing here) So I won't pity you if you're computer dies for unexpected reasons. Time for another quote from the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK!!! Code: 843 of the Flaming Chicken Handbook states that in no way is the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who?) responsible for any faulty wiring or lack thereof in your computer. The Patron Saint of Paper Clips in no way wishes harm on your computer. Any derogatory statement is simply an opinion of an individual, not of the flaming order of the flaming chickens. Said order will in no way be held responsible for any damages, injuries, loss of life, limb, head, or organs. Okay, quote is done. Maybe I should put quotation marks around them...nah, too much work. But I probably will eventually get around to having a seperate page just for the FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK. That way all the members (what members) can print out a copy of it for themselves (if they didn't get that copy in the mail) I guess I'm done for the day...I know. You want me to stay. It's okay. Because eventually, I'll be back! Seeya! I'm back. And once again suprised. When I was at a TAB poetry thingy (TAB is good TAB is great We love TAB) I met some new people. One of these people (who shall remain nameless untill such time that I have explicit permission to use her name) turned out to be almost as weird as me. As in...she read the ENTIRE Longest Text Ever. The whole thing. So far two whole people (to my knowledge) have read the entire thing, and a few people have skimmed it. That means I really can justify claiming to have two and a half readers! I'm so happy! That means my pointless obsession has actually entertained someone besides me! Perhaps, one day, far in the future, this will actually be a world record and random people will acutally voluntarily read this text every day. Or maybe not. The point is that it is nice to have readers. Or maybe it's not...I mean...won't the quality *snicker* of my work deteriorate if I am no longer writing for the target audience of me? If that happens, then no one will read this. And then I'll be writing for me again. And then the quality will rise. And then people will start reading. And then the quality will go down and the vicious spiral of good and bad will continue untill I either give up this text, or go crazy...er. In any case...I should probably find a topic. Yeah...a topic would be good. Or...I could just continue to write about finding a topic. Ooooo! I know a topic! Ice cream trucks! This has been bothering me for a while. You see...when it's hot, you want something cold to eat. Conviently, ice cream trucks come around during the hottest part of the year (it must be a conspiracy). As you may or may not know, small children swarm the ice cream trucks. The vendors even play whimsical music which I strongly suspect contains subliminal messages to make you hungry for ice cream. The vendors get oodles of cash, and the kids get ice cream. Now, in today's society of buying groceries on-line and getting them delivered, why hasn't any other food industry marketed this ingenius idea to bring the product to the consumer. I can just see Hot Dog, and Pizza trucks roaming the neighbor hoods, selling treats to hungry children...and adults. Of course, said adults would have to peel their butt-cheeks off the couch...but they'd have to do that for the delivary man anyway. The food trucks could even play music that made you hungry for their food. Then the problem with obesity in America would be blamed on evil food truck drivers as opposed to the harmless, benificient television and computer. We could all breath a sigh of relief as parents kept their children inside, away from the evil truck drivers and near the T.V. Gone would be the days when parents told children to play outside, it's a nice day. Parents would buy their children computers, video games and other television neccesities. This, of course would expand the market for such products. This would lead to a better, more stable economy. Food industires would be buying cars, gas and music. Parents would increase the purchase of entertainment items. In return companies would make a profit, pay their workers better. The workers would then be able to afford more entertainment items and the upward spiral would continue, as opposed to the evil downward spiral of my writing. In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen...if you implement my idea, there will be peace and prosperity for all. As long as you don't mind a few more couch potatoes. Gotta go...I think I hear a catchy jingle. I'm back...it's been awhile since I've written here. A lot has happened. Like my EVIL school computer deleting my updates page. But it's all good. Especially since I just saw The Matrix: Reloaded. The following text may spoil the movie for you, so WARNING: do no read this unless you have already seen the movie. Okay. What I liked best was the philosophy on choices. (the mindless fight scenes were really cool, too). It's like this. In the beginning of the movie, Neo is having dreams about Trinity's death. Later, The Oracle tells him that he has already decided her fate. Towards the end of the movie, Neo chooses to tell Trinity to stay out of the Matrix, since he saw her die in it. She agrees, but only after seeing how important it is to him. After a horrific chain of events (is it coincidence, or fate) the people who will deactivate the secondary power source of the building Neo is infiltrating, die. So...the plan is going to fail. Unless someone does something, Neo, Morpheus and many others will die. Trinity, who is of course outside of the Matrix, knows this and chooses to enter the Matrix to save the day. The events of Neo's dream unfold. So...when the oracle said that the choice had already been made, she was completely correct. The moment Neo woke from dreams of Trinity's death, he made a choice. He would do everything in his power to keep his dream from becoming reality. So he kept her out of the Matrix, and she saw the problem, and entered the Matrix to fix it. If she had been in the Matrix, she would have likely been with Morpheus, never would have known about the plan's failure, would therefore not have been in the situation that resulted in her death. And the plan would have failed and Neo might have died, along with a large portion of the city (the building was set to blow if there was any intruders) So...Neo's choice to attempt to save Trinity triggered the sequence of events that led to her death. As Neo realizes all of this, through a nearly omniscient Architect of the Matrix, he makes another choice. This choice is simply an extension of his original choice: he will save Trinity at all costs. Neo is told that he has two choices. He can save mankind, and doom Trinity. Or he can try to save Trinity and doom mankind. No guarantee that he'll succeed in saving Trinity. He goes for Trinity, makes it just in time to catch her body, and starts her heart back up. In return for not taking the easy route, he gains a power in the more or less real world. He can deactivate the machines, (squidies) but at great personal cost. The movie ends with him in a coma. Now, you must realize that I have described only one aspect of this movie of all movies. There are not enough words in the English language to describe the sheer coolness of the fight choreography, special effects and the plot. I highly recommend you see the movie yourself. I'm sorry that today's rant isn't random, insane or completely chaotic, but I must right my experience with The Matrix before I forget. I am so buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. I love it! You have to admit its sheer coolness. I mean, come on! It's the sequel to the movie that revolutionized the standard by which we judge special effects. I better stop typing before I have a heart attack...just remember...The Matrix has you...I'm back. And throughly pissed off at my school system in general. You see...they feel that the only way to reward academic achievement...yada-yada-yada...is to force the smart kids to be ushers for Senior Honor Nite, and Graduation. Where is the logic in this? I for one, didn't know about such dire consequences for not deliberatly failing classes. It was bad enough that I was forced to "volunteer" my precious time (i could have worked on this site)...no...I was forced to wear formal attire. My school system is stuck in the past...and formal attire means...a dress...a white dress...(for those you who never bothered to find out...I am indeed female). So...for the first time in about 5 years...I wore a dress...and something that was complelty white. What cruel fate is this? To compound the EVIL situation...I was forced to wear feminine shoes. In other words...they hurt. And they pushed my toes together. Since I have a rather weird phobia of touching my own skin...this made my evening my own personall torture session. I think that such gender-specific torture should be deemed inhumane and abolished from our great society...of flaming chickens. Henceforth...Code: 666 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that under no circumstance will the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who) be forced to wear anything other than a t-shirt and preferably black jeans. Should you violate this right, you will become destroyed or possibly dizzy. I'm leaving now...I have some destruction to do. i'm back. from graduation. we had to get there one hour and fifteen minutes early because there was traffic. After standing around a lot...the ceremony started. Lots of people spoke. by the time I had to do my part (tell people where to stand before getting their diploma) it was dark. there were bugs. they liked landing on me. then...i got to go stand while people said a lot of stuff. i couldn't hear it because someone had put the speakers facing the audience. we clapped. the whole time, even during the name-calling, seniors were playing with silly string and beachballs. afterwards...they turned off the lights. there were lots of fireworks. i wandered around for 20 minutes looking for a cell phone. i called home, and waited another hour for my ride...traffic to the school was one way. i felt sorry for my dad. i am tired...but cannot go to sleep. i'll copy and paste this to my site. maybe the longest text ever. you will all suffer as i have suffered when and if you graduate. i cannot feel my feet. i hate dress shoes. I'm back. Today, I'm here to salute the Pointless Signs Of America! The PSOA have been whole-heartedly working for you, and what have you done for them? NOTHING! These so-called "pointless" signs are doing just what they were meant to do: entertain you! You cannot judge them simply because they have no apparant function. They expand your mind, making you think about all the things they could do. They could do anything they wanted to, if they just put their minds to it. If you judged everything by what it doesn't acomplish, then the entire world is populated by pointless beings. Noone can do everything, so how can you expect a SIGN, with the I.Q. of toilet paper, to do everything. You people sicken me. You expect far to much of the inanimate world. The inanimate world, on the otherhand, expects nothing of you. Which is exactly what it gets. If you expect nothing, and get nothing, you feel nothing. If you expect nothing and get something, you're happy. But, if you expect something and get something you feel nothing. And if you expect something and get nothing, you feel cheated. If you're following along, and not completly confused, you'll realize that it is better to be a pessimist than an optomist. Yep that's right. This entry went from saluting the PSOA to making a statement about my ideals. This has been a weird day. You can thank my associate "Meg" she came up with the PSOA acronym. Everyone, clap for "Meg".I gotta go...seeya later! I'm finnaly back! Today, I took a long look at this site, which is the acomplishment of almost a year of work. And I asked myself "How could I have better spent my time?" And so, in the interest of wasting even more time, I made a list. Here we go! Number One: I could have cured cancer. Not that I know anything about medicine...or cancer for that matter. But I'm sure that if I just would have put my mind to it, I could have done it. Number Two: I could helped the earth to find eternal and lasting peace. Which would be boring. So I at least have an excuse for not doing that. Number Three: I could have studied and stuff. Uh...don't think so...Number Four: I could have learned to drive. This would have resulted in the deaths of numerous pedistrians...and I would still probably be wondering around in search of a McDonalds. Number Five: I could have read more books, played more video games and watched more mindless television. Gee...I wish I'd thought of that sooner. Number Six: I could have implemented one of several plans for world domination. Or, as an alternative, I could have ruined several plans for world domination that other people made. Number Seven: I could drive people crazy. Wait...aren't I already doing that? Scratch number seven. And on to: Number Eight: I could have...uhhhh...ummmmm...actually thought up these things before hand. Number Nine: Now it's just getting redundant, isn't it? Number Ten: This is the list that never ends. Yes, it goes on and on my friend. One person, started typing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue typing it forever just because this is the list that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some person started typing it not...etc, etc. Okay...I admit it. I have officialy run out of ways I could have better spent my time. I don't think there actually are any. Except for maybe five and six. Now, those have possibilities. However, I am currently content to just sit here and type. For the benefit of you, the reader...who may or may not exist. Either way, I'm continuing to sort of entertain myself. I feel like I should be outraged about some topic or another. I just can't work up the energy to be outraged. Perhaps a nice, soothing mistrust. Yeah. I can work with mistrust. I definitly mistrust lots of stuff. Like organ grinders, and the evil conspiracies. Did you know, that Kodak was part of the conspiracy to assasinate John F. Kennedy. Now, some of you are probably thinking "Gee, Really?", or "Wow, I never knew that!" while others are thinking "Who's John F. Kennedy?" or possibly "Who or What is Kodak". I fervently hope that you're not thinking the last two...especially about Kodak. Kodak, as you may know, is a film developing company. And John F. Kennedy (JFK) was an alien bent on global domination. Or possibly a really good president who wanted to fly to the moon. Either way, he got assasinated. And ever loony in America decided that it was a conspiracy. Some even go so far as to claim that Kodak "changed" the pictures of the assasination to make an assasination in the bushes become a tree's shadow. I didn't know that they had such good technology back then. I have to wonder...why would Kodak do such a thing. Perhaps Kodak is actually a front organization for a shadowy governmental system that controls the entire world and didn't want mankind to obtain the freedom of the stars and so tried to sabotauge the space program even though it didn't work as well as they planned. Or perhaps not. Either way, Kodak is undeniably evil. How can any company that takes so many "wholesome" pictures not be? You can just bet that they look at every one that get's turned in to them, judging blackmail value, and whether or not you could get arrested. It's just sickening, you can't even take a simple photo nowadays. Unless you have a digital camera, which are a symbol of freedom from the old ways and willing enslavement to the new ways. We can only hope that the digital camera manufacturers are kinder masters than the evil Kodak Lords. I better go...I think Kodak is tracing my site....I'm back now! And, once again, I have proof that someone actually took the time (two hours) to read this entire Longest Text Ever! It's amazing, it's incredible, it's unbelievable. But true. Even more incredible, this time it's someone I don't even know! Wooooooo! I feel inspired and happy and other really good emotions and stuff. And so, I'll take a trip down memory lane, to the dark depths of the past, to when I decided to make this page. It was inspired, in part, by my sheer and utter boredom. In school, back before I even owned a computer, I'd type random words for long periods of time, 'cause I had nothing better to do. Once I got this computer, I decided to do something similar on my beloved site. But, it ended up making more sense than I anticipated (scary thought, huh). Oh, well...I tired of nostalgia. Back to the present. Right now, I'm just typing so that no one can say that I've been slacking off. I don't think I have any conspiracy theories...except pop-ups/pop-unders. Have you ever had the evil pop-up that says that if you click here, it'll get rid off all the annoying pop-ups? Isn't that sort of ironic? Could the pop-up blocker people have chosen a better means to advertise their product? It's like grand-theft auto 3's talk show, you know, the one where there are Citizens Raging Against Phones? Or CRAP, for short. And the lady representing them, calls the radio station...on a phone. It's stupid and ironic and just shouldn't exist in a better world. Pop-Up ad's help you get rid of pop-up ads? Insane, chaotic...hmmmmm...I wonder who thought of it? Was it on purpose, or was it just some mistake? It is now my civic duty to discover this ancient mystery, and reveal it to the uncaring world. Or maybe I'll go make a frozen pizza. Yeah. That sounds good, too. Since I'm not particualarly inspired at the moment, I should leave and let you gather what is left of your sanity. I just can't seem to stop, though. Okay...I can do it. I'm leaving. I'm back...and it's several hours later. I've decided to imortalize the stupidity of my dog, Moose. She is a heavy-set Yorkshire Terrior (12 lbs.) In otherwords, she's a small yappy dog who is big for her breed. Today, I met her arch-enemy. An enemy so terrifying that Moose cannot stop shaking. An enemy so hideous that Moose must destroy it at all costs. An enemy so dangerous that Moose fears it above all others. Now you may be wondering what horrible beast is Moose's arch-enemy. And you probably suspect that it is something pathetic. You would be correct in your suspiciousness...for Mooses arch-enemy is...*dramatic drumroll*...a small, white, feather. Now, Moose has seen many feathers, birds even. But none have struck terror in her little moose heart like this particular feather. So...naturally I put her arch-enemy in my pocket and brought it home with me. This action has made her very suspicious of where my loyalties lie. She tracks the feather smell all over the house, and goes crazy whenever I take it out of my pocket. She even got her sister and mother in the spirt of things. Now her sister sounds an alarm whenever she sees the evil feather. Now, you may be wondering what is so terrifying about a small, white, feather. So am I. It doesn't smell funny, (I asked my brother, since I don't have a sense of smell), it seems perfectly ordinary. So, I've decided that Moose works for some secret government organization, and that the feather is the key to the destruction of the world, and I am just blithely letting it enter our home, so that it may furthur its evil plans to destroy the universe. That is the only possible explanation as to why it upsets her so much. Or...maybe it's the feather off of the cartoon owl from the tootsie-roll pop comercials (one...two...three..*crunch*). Whatever the case, I decided that the whole world, (or three of four random people) deserve to know that if the world and or universe are destroyed, it's the evil, little, white, feather's fault. Now I'd better go and torture my Moose with it...:) I am officially back. And you, the potentially non-existant reader gets a once in a lifetime chance to hear me rant and rave about my Horrible, Horrible Family Vacation. I know. You feel very, very honored. It's like this. My mother is a control freak, and she decided on the spur of the moment that we were going north to visit relatives. Later that day, she decided we were NOT going north, we were going south to a beach resort. Still later that day, she got offended at some trivial thing and decided that we weren't going anywhere at all. The very next day, she decided that we were going north, after all. So, we packed everthing up. Before we knew it, we were on the road. The first part of the trip was fairly easy. As in, I was half-asleep, hoping that we'd arrive while I slept. Then, in an inspired move, my brother talked my mother into letting him sit up front. That meant that my mother would be in the back, with me and my younger, eviler sister. Immediatly, my mother started complaining. It was uncomfortable in the back, it was too hot, it was too cold. Then, she accidently woke our three yappy dogs up, and they relized that they were in a car. That meant only one corse of action for them. They started shaking and barked their little heads off. This annoyed my mother further, untill she asked, no, demanded that my father turn the car around so that we could go home. Unfortuantly, we had already driven 337 miles toward our destination. After much argument, my father was going to turn around, untill he realized that my mother was going to drop the dogs and me off, and then turn around and continue north. This seemed slightly unpracticle, so we ended up not taking that 337 mile detour. We eventually reached our destination after 16 hours of virtually non-stop driving. We got there, we ate. We slept. My mother visited relatives. And so the week went by. I got to go to a huge library, and see Terminator 3 at the local theater. That was the high point of the entire trip. The last day, we were deciding where to eat. My mom said that she didn't care. So my dad picked a steak place. My mother tried to order a mushroom-swiss burger...only to discover that the place had no swiss-cheese. So she decided on a salad, only to discover that they didn't have her favorite salad dressing. After much deliberation, she decided that she wouldn't eat. After complaining how hungry she was, and about the poor quality of the resteraunt, she walked out of the resteraunt, instructing the rest of us to "enjoy our meals". And I wonder where my little sister gets her annoyingness. Not that my mother is annoying...just set in her ways. The whole meal thing was about the only interesting thing to happen during the week. On the way home, we had gotten approximatly 4 hours into the trip when my mother predicatably decided that we had to go back and eat at the 50th aniversary of her favorite ice cream place. Needless to say, we ignored her. Oh, and when my sister had to go to the bathroom very badly during a traffic jam, my mother had the good taste to making hissing/water noises to make my sister's problem worse. She claimed that my little sister always did it to her, and she was getting pay-back. Between her bickering with my sister, and obsessivly playing neopets games, I don't know what to do with her. Anyway...that was my family vacation rant. It sucked. No suprise. At least it's over. Sorry if I complained a lot. If you don't like it, start your own longest text ever. Anyway, I promise to go back to my usual routine the next time I rant here. I thought of a topic on the way home, but forgot it. Seeya. I'm back! I know, I took you completly by suprise. You thought you'd gotten rid of me. *cheesy super-hero voice* Well, fear not, random citizen, for I, PSOPC am here! *normal voice* Today I have a very important to discuss with you in this: PERFECTLY NORMAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCMENT. Yes, that's right. It's time to warn you, the viewer...er...reader...about the evils of various stuff. Today's lesson is: subliminal messages . That's right, folks, mass hypnosis via commercials. Now, I'm sure you've at least heard of subliminal messages , right? No? Well...prepare to be enlightened. Subliminal messages are an advertising technique that puts hidden pictures and words into a main image. You don't see them, but your subconsious (dreaming) mind does. Your subconsious mind acts on whatever it is told. What does this mean to you? It means that WAL-MART TV IS EVIL! EVIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!! Why else would they invest all that money to show commercials in their own store? Because they put subliminal messages in them, of course! Subliminal messanging also explains the successes of certain fast-food resteraunts, and brand name items. BEWARE YOUR TOASTER OVEN! Okay. That had nothing to do whatsoever with subliminal messages...it's just cool to say. Anyway, only watch wal-mart if you WANT to be subliminaly entertained into purchasing a new set of TUPERWARE, even though your old set is PERFECTLY fine. This has been a public service announcment. Pretty cool, huh? Uh...you don't have to take the subliminal stuff seriously. It's true, and all, but I have no proof about wal-mart, or certain fast food resteraunts. It makes sense, though. Wal-mart TV is evil. You cannot deny it. Seeya...hmmm..I wonder if there's subliminal stuff in my computer...I'm back. And I feel that it's time for a FAKE commercial break, for the highly informed, obviously brain-dead consumer. And now, a word from our non-existant sponsor.

I bet you wanna go eat some Ketchup covered Dum-B Gon right now, while watching "reality" TV. Just make sure you "spray" your food first. Pathetic, wasn't it? Oh, well. I was bored, and a dilligent reader suggested I make fake commercials, so...therer they are. Happy? Good. I'm leavin', for now. I'm back. And I'm willing to enlighten you, the potentially you-know-what reader. Today, I was checking out some weird news. At one point, I read an article that stated that it had been proven, conclusivly, that Kansas was flatter than the standard pancake. The researches even used highly advanced technololgy to map the surface of a pancake and compare it to documented geology of Kansas. Some people disagree, the director of the Kansas Geological Survey said "I think this is part of a vast breakfast food conspiracy to denigrate Kansas. It's a cheap shot." So...doesn't that make you want to take Kansas' side (I sincerly appologize if you are from Kansas). It just seems extremly weird (and worthy of mentioning) that this semi-important guy from Kansas believes in a "vast breakfast food conspiracy". Makes you think that the long held belief that Kodak conspired with the JFK assasin(s) is normal. Another article claims that an anitseptic turned a polar bear purple, drawing large crowds of people. I sure hope other zoos won't copy them. Before you know it, we'll have orange alligators, pink tigers and blue lions. School children won't be able to correctly identify the color of a zebra. Random people will think they've gone crazy, after a seemingly innocent visit to the zoo. It's wrong, I tell you. A complete and total degregation of our societies values. What values, you say? The basic moral belief that Polar bears should be WHITE. Unless we spray-painted the snow purple, too. Then it would be okay. As long as the bear blends in, you know? Speaking of animals, there's a cat in California who is a kleptomaniac (likes to steal stuff). He sneaks into neighboring homes, and takes clothing, wrapped christmas presents, and anything he can find. He then leaves them under his owners car. Okay, better leave. I'm back. And I don't really have a topic today. I'm just bored. Sometimes I just do this, you know? Start typing without any idea about what it is I intend to say. Maybe I subconsiously DO know what I'm doing here, but refuse to admit it to myself. Or maybe I am monumentally bored and don't have anything else to do at the moment. Either way, I'm here. You must be pretty bored, too. Otherwise, why on earth (beta, krpto, zkdjf, Planet X, whatever) would you be here? It would make no sense. If you have something better to do, why wouldn't you be doing it right now? I would be. But, maybe that's just the difference between you and me. Yeah. That must be it. Unless you're bored. Then I completly understand. I need to find a topic. Here, topic, topic, topic! Come on, I won't hurt you, I promise! *hides large ax behind back* Come here, topic! Why are you afraid of little ol' me? *sigh* There are no topics anywhere near me. Kinda like me and "Meg" webcomic we are trying to do. It's called Hit-Or-Miss, any topics, plot, etc. are completly accidental and are not the fault/responsibility of the creators. That was sort of a topic, even though it was sort of random. Which is what I do best. Okay, I'm done with that litte commercial. What now...hmmmmm...should I share with you more of my paranoid/delusional conspiracy theories? Or have I been doing that too much lately? Oooooo! I know, I'll start of list of why it's fun/good to be insane/weird! #1You can say or do anything and normal people will agree with you in the hopes that you'll be satisfied, shut up, and go away. Far away. I will show you an example with this completly true stuff that I experienced several years ago. ME: My vicious, psychotic, flesh-eating bunny-rabbit wants to rule the world. RANDOM PERSON: Uh-huh, that's nice. ME: Yeah, but I told her that she'd be a terible ruler. I mean, she traded Asia for a carrot! And she doesn't even LIKE carrots! RANDOM PERSON: You don't say? ME: Yep. She also is the goddess of red jello. RANDOM PERSON: *head explouding from sheer insanity* As you can see, I was a very weird child (this happened in elementary school...uh...except for that head-explouding part). Okay...on to: #2 You can get out of practically anything by saying: a)It's against my religion b)I'm allergic to that. c)I have an extremly irrational fear of that. d)I already did that in a past life and it sucked. e)My psychotic bunny predicted I'd die doing it. Unfortunalty, several of those reasons LEGITAMITLY apply to a certain activity I do every Tuesday, which WILL NOT BE NAMED HERE LEST I GIVE IT POWER OVER ME! I'm allergic to parts of it, have irrational fears about others and I'm pretty sure it's against my Jenny religion...along with eating mashed potatoes, or potatoes of any kind. I'll add that to the FLAMING CHICKENS HANDBOOK. Thou shalt not eat spuds. Hmmmm...time for #3You can obsessive over ANYTHING, and people will think nothing of it. I, personally, am obsessed with, kitties, bunnies, bats, this website, drawing, making intriate little patterns with strings, doing mildly repetitive activities, being weird, apparantly making lists and cheese...and chickens...and flame. Fire is good. Fire is free. Fire is my friend...until it burns me. Then it must die...painfully. And on to:#4You make your friends look normal in comparison. And #5: You can give each of your pets several weird names such as: Ringling-Raison-Bailey-Suzana-Midnight-Schultz, Squirell, Moose, Moose-Moose, Moosey-Moose, Linzey-Moose, Muffin, Squirell-Muffin, Yabby-Doodle, Abby Normal, Wiggle-Baby, Wiggle-Muffin, Witle-Baby, Cheese-Monkey, Muffin-With-Squirell-Juice, Squirell-With-Muffin Juice, Moosey-Juice, Squirell-Monkey, etc. Now, wasn't that a fun list!? Doesn't that just make you proud to be weird? I should make bumber stickers saying that. Proud to be weird. It'd be cool. Anyway, gotta go! *yawn* I'm back. Last night I was super-charged with lots of sugar and not a lot of sleep. I ended up writing things during the time of night when EVERYTHING is hilarious, including the word sheep. To compound things, I wasn't alone, and things just escalated. The following is everything I wrote during that sugar-coated time period. Some are answers to e-mails, the rest are just stuff I wrote.

        Definitly. THen we go to library. Guess what? Me and Josh ate lots and lots of sugar, and it's late at nite and everything is funny but we can't laugh 'cause everybody is sleepin' so it's even funnier but ever since we drank the water we sobered up even though we weren't drunk but we ate sugar...lots and lots of sugar. MOstly donut cake. Okay. JOsh says it was only one piece of cake. WE got it at Wal-mart. Or his mom did. OR something. Goodbye...oh, and the fresh chicken wings might be to blame. they were special wings. I hope I remember doing this. I think it's pretty funny. > You have blue hari..*gigles* I like hair. Josh says I probably won't remember writing any of this, but I can't sleep. THe cake was good. aSk anybody. Big Brother may be listening right now so I beter go. They're listening for a secrret...no it's cause of a secret. But the secret doesn't exist so they are stupid. *g8ggles* bye. Yes. Megan has hair. I've seen it. *giggling* It's very, very late at nite. ONly not really. i like sugar. NO, wait. It's early. WE have been having very profound thoughts lately. We think. THey might havve been important, but we keep forgetting them. We're not sure. Josh wants his thought back. *sniffle* i do, too. It's not fair. I think mine involved a jaunty song to sing. But I couldn't have sung it 'cause it would have woken everyone up and they would have called me inconsiderate. I have to get up really early to leave for home. I should be asleep. *gigles* It milght have been a sugar rush 'cause now we're having a sugar crash. OR, maybe it's the writing. Okay, maybe it was the ranch dressing instead of the special, fresh buffalo wings. But they really were'nt buffoal wings 'cause buffalo's don't have wings...cause they come off when they are babies, JOsh says so and he must be right causse he's been having Profound Thoughts even though he cannot remember them. But, the wings were'nt really special. I don't think. Maybe we're just really, really tired and had sugar. I don't want to play the stupid animal war card game 'cause the stupdi bear gets eaten by an eaagle.. ...goodbye ssslllee0yyyyslllllllleeeeeeeepppppppppppppyyyyyyyyyyy iiiiiiiiissssssssssssss gggggggggoooooooooooooddddddddddddd.............

        As you can see, I was in a very interesting state of mind. I hadn't had a genuine sugar rush since I was 11. It was fairly fun. Although I acted like an idiot. Oh, well. I have more stuff to write, but I gotta go right now. Stay tuned to hear my thoughts on tanning, and an evil card game, and who knows what else...Okay I'm back. Here's what I wrote this weekend: Woooooo! 5000 hits! Aren't I special? *sigh* I can't think of anything to write. But I must. I must defeat the sister site of the Longest Text Ever! I mean, I've been doing this much, much longer than the other person. Hmmmmm...monkey. Why do weird people (myself included) obsess about monkeys? And, are monkeys spelled monkies? It just looks weird. Like a division of mounties made entirely out of monks. I bet it's spelled monkeys. It looks right. Maybe I should use spell-check. But...that'd be a lot of work, unlike ranting, raving and rambling. Hey, it's the 3 r's! No longer does school teach use reading, riting and 'rithmitic, it now teaches us ranting, raving and rambling! (and redundancy!) After all, isn't that basicly what the best teachers do? It sets a perfect example for you young, impressionable minds. Those are the best kind. *yet another highly dramatic, time-consuming sigh* I need a topic. A good one. Not one of those bargain ones anyone can find at your local topic discount outlet store. I'll rant and rave and ramble about the EVILS of sunlight. Most people actually like to spend long periods of time exposing their vulnerable skin to the harmful rays of the sun. These people have obviously suffered major brain damage from their prolonged exposure to the sun. The actually think that their skin's efforts to protect them are ATTRACTIVE. It'd be like someone thinking that scabs are atractive, 'case they protect you from disease. Then everyone would cut and scrape themselves to be covered in scabs. That's exactly what tanning is like. Purposly damaging the skin so you can look "attractive". Now, a long time ago, people were sort of smarter. They avoided the sun at all costs. They associated tans with hard, manuel labor. Then, some fasion bimbo went on a fasionable safarii to get some fasionable furs, or whatever. When she came back, 'lo and behold, she had a tan. This resourceful young vanguard of fasion decided to cover her extreme embarassment by acting like she meant to horribly damage herself. And because she was the head fasion bimbo, everyone agreed that the look was definitly "in". So, everyone went to the beach and got tans. Girls began wearing skimpier, and skimpier bathing suits. Men, of course, had no complaints. (Though whether it was the tan or the skimpy suits, no one will ever know.) As you read this Historicly Accurate Anecdote, you must realize the parallel between it and the fable The Emperoro's New Clothes. Someone did something incredbly stupid, but because they were powerful, everone acted like it was a stroke of genius. And the preceding generations became brain-washed (possibly through subliminal messages in sun-tan lotion commercials) to believe tans were expected. Those few who actually could think and avoided the sun were considered to be outcasts. I don't mean to insult you if you DO have a tan. I am simply explaining why I, personally, refuse to swim, go to the beach, sunbathe, leave the house, etc. Alrighty then. I'm gonna quit for now. I'm back. I'm so very, very tired. School has been on for four days now. I have three very hard academic classes. They give lots and lots of homework. Two and a half hours of homework (total) to be precise. I get home from work at 5:30p.m. and eat dinner. Then I do my homework. I get done at 9:15. Then I wait for my mom and dad to stop playing Collapse II so that I can get on. I usually have less than 30 minutes. It sucks. I can't really work on this site even though I now have a more in depth understanding of variables. I learned this from my calculator. I made a virtual pet for it. It was fun. I'm tired. Did I mention that, yet. My calculator is nifty. Sometimes, it is lazy. It tells me stuff like: "Warning: More Solutions May Exist" and "Questionable Accuracy". So...it doesn't bother to find all solutions, and it may be wrong. Geee....that is comforting. I love my calculator, though. It does all my Math for me. I hate Math. Math is so picky. In English, and stuff, if you miss one little detail, at most you lose partial credit, but you usually get it all right. In Math, one teeny, tiny little mistake will make you get the entire thing wrong. I tend to make those tiny mistakes, and get bad grades, even if I understand the concepts. I hate Math. I'm tired. Are you tired. I sure am. Guess what I wanna do. How did you ever guess? That's right, I wanna sleep. Why can't I? Hmmmm...good question. I think I'm so tired I can't sleep. Plus...I gots oblimagations...obligaton....obligations to this site. yeah. thats it...i so tired...bye-bye. I'm back. And more than slightly embarassed. Today my frazzled-brain produced something that is decidedly Jenny (that's my more or less "real" name). I was contemplating how my heavy load of books made me like a bulldozer and than I was about to suggest to my friend, "Meg" that we invent one. Then I realized that the buldozer already HAD been invented. That's how I knew it's name, picture and what it did. That is just...pathetic. School is taking its toll. *sigh* *sniffle* *snort* *insert word that is a sound that begins with an "s" here* I don't have much time, so, I must be brief. I'm not sure how I CAN be brief since I have absolutly nothing to say. The best way to be brief is to quit now. Right now. Which is what I'm about to do. Any miniute now. I promise. Okay. Bye! *sigh* My dogs are just weird. You remember my Moose's arch-enemy, don't you? You know, the small, white feather. Well, my squirell now has an arch-enemy. At least her's makes sense...sort of. Her enemy is a fake Yorkshire Terrior (same species as her) made entirely out of goat hair. She HATES and FEARS it. She'll shake and run from it, then suddenly dive and bite it's head. She goes crazy if someone holds it, 'cause it's getting attention and not her. I'm fairly certain she knows it's not alive, though. Maybe she just doesn't like goat-smell. In any case, she is clearly insane. Just like everyone else in my family. In other news, I participated in the Second Battle of the Asparagus Wars and chronicled them here. I'll add a link to the main page when I get around to it. It gave me new insight into how weird I am. I fought with vegitables, covered myself in bubble wrap, groveled before the Great Banana and dodge skittles and flying doughnuts and rubber chikens. The entire message board was like one big insane asylum. Needless to say, I felt right at home. Well, seeya *waves brightly* I got to go to my Grendel (really cool book) project for school. I's making fake soundtracks like the teacher told me! BYE!!! Okay...I'm back. Today's rant is a panic rant. There are not going to be conspiracies...or humor of any kind. I think. *let the panic begin!* IT'S NOT FAIR! Why do I have to work year round? I only signed up for a semester. I was looking forward to having A elective, while everyone else was enjoying three or four...or even more. Oooo..I'm a poet, and don't I know it? In any case...it's awful. It's bad enough to go to school, leave school, go to work, leave work, do homework and then wait for my dad to get off of the computer so that I can do stuff. I want SOME free time. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I spend from 8-5 doing what everyone else wants. When is it MYturn? Next semester will be almost exactly like this one. Even though my schedule is technically supposed to be completly differnt. You see, my school has "block" scheduling. That means I take four classes this semester and four different classes next year. But one of my classes is work, and two others are horrible year-round classes. So next semester I'll still have work, AP Lit, and AP Physics. It's not FAIR. Physics is so FREAKIN' hard! I don't understand it. I have no problem with Lit. Okay. Work. I love my work, I love the kids I work with. But I HATE spending three hours of every day in a "class" when everyone else's class is only an hour and a half. I don't care if I have to ride the bus home if I stop work. I don't care if I'd get home only an hour or so before I normaly do. I want an elective. Maybe. I think. All I know is that I've been assuming one thing while the person in charge has been assuming a completly different thing. Neither of us thought to question the other. And so I'm in deep doo-doo. *sniffle* I just want to have some FREAKIN' variety in my daily grind, you know? I don't WANT to do the same thing for an entire year. Yeah, I know, regular schedule schools do that. I pity them, I really do. I've spent the past three years of my life EXPECTING each semester to be like a mini-year. I DO NOT LIKE CHANGE! This is just way too much of a change at once. I don't want year-round classes. I don't want a full year of work. I don't want to be in this mess...I'm going to bed. I'm back. I don't have much of a choice about the whole work thing. Plus, the kids at the daycare (where I work, obviously) say that I'm "cool to talk to". That makes me feel alll warm and fuzzy inside. Like a muffin. They just like how I know lots of pointless laws and random facts. Okay. ON TO THE CONPIRACY OF THE DAY!: I've had this nagging fear that I am part of some random but vast conspiracy (about what I'm not sure but it must be vast). Meanwhile there is a vast conspiracy at school to keep me ignorant about my pawn roll in the other vast conpiracy by keeping me vastly bored. (In a very vast sense) And: did you ever notice that the word "conspiracy" is vastly similar to the word "constipation". I only mention this 'cause I've accidently spelled constipation instead of conspiracy a few times. (on accident, vast number of times) Hee-Hee! Isn't vast a funny word? You can just picture sterotypical pirates saying, "A vast ye mateys!". I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sure is funny:) You don't agree? Shame on you! Code: 888 of The Flaming Chickens Handbook states that The Patron Saint of Paperclips (still me) is always right. ALWAYS. If the facts beg to differ, than the facts are wrong. End of story. Seeya. I'm back. I've been playing one of the new neopets slot machines (black pawkeet). I'm completly and totally addicted. Gambling is so much fun! I've won 500 np, at least and I'm on a roll. Now sure, I could have won more than 500 at some game in which you don't have to pay to play. But, what would be the fun in that? I even came up with a mathematical explanation for why gambling is fun (while I was eating a hyper-speed dinner, thinking nothing of getting back to the slot machine). Okay. If you don't understand the concept of numbers less than zero, (negative numbers) just skip this part. Imagine a number line that points in the positive and negative direction. When I start playing a game, I am on 0. I have neither won nor lost money/neopoints. When I win 500np on a normal game, I move to the 500 point. There is exactly 500 units of distance between the two extremes of winning amounts (0 and 500) BUT! When I play a gambling game, there is a possibility that I'll lose everything, so I start on negative however much NP I have with me. If I had 500np with me, I'd be at-500. Then, when I win 500 additional np, I move to the 500np point. The distance between the two extremes of how much I could have won is 1000np, making me feel like I've won much more than if I'd played a normal game. Did you understand that? Good. I probably won't later. But that is irrelevant. Goodbye! I am back. And I hava a very, almost special rant for you. The previous sentence made absolutly no sense. Good for it. In a recent article, humorist Dave Barry discussed the addictive quality of the snack food, Cheez-Its. Naturally, I had many mixed feelings, primarily disgust, as I have not voluntarily eaten a Cheez-It in quite some time. They're disgusting, bland and definitly not made of cheez, whatever that is. My family has always bought Cheez-Its, to the point of making me physically sick at the thought of eating one. (To this day, however, I will almost literally kill for a box of Cheez-It party mix, as it is a rare commodity at my house.) Fortunatly, my mom recently finnaly switched our snack food preference. To Cheese Nips. Say it. Out loud. What does it sound like? When you look at them they are identical to the evil little Cheez-Its. The only difference is the taste, which I enjoy, since it is new and different. What I want to know is this: are there no intelectual property rights in the world of food products? I mean, don't you think the creators of Cheese-Nips had a box of Cheez-Its out when they were designing their product? It seems like blaggerent plagerism. The only reason the makers of Cheese-Nips don't get sued is because of the tast difference and Cheese Nips are made of real "cheese" rather than cheez. It makes you think of Name-Brand vs. Generic cereal brands. They are the samething, with the same look, and almost same name. But people buy name brands. Why, because they assume it's better quality. Plus, boxes are more convient than bags. A profound statement, if I ever heard one. Any way, I'm leaving to eat some Cheessy goodness! I'm back. Apparantly my standards of weird have gone up. This morning, my Mom came home from work. She was upset, because she had accidently run over an armidillo. She said she hurt it the first time, and wanted to put it out of it's misery, so she went back and ran over it 11 more times. But it's legs were still moving and it was alive. She was extremly upset. When I related this story to my friends (including "Meg") they thought it was hilarious. They couldn't stop laughing. I thought it was sad...and normal. They particularly liked how I said that she went back and ran over it 11 more times. I'm not sure why. Of course, when I next saw my Mom, she retold the story to me, several times. With the exact same words, motions and emotions. She didn't think it was weird, either. Perhaps my family is just so weird, we've lost all sense of perspective. Or maybe it's everybody else that's weird. I just don't know. What do you think, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know either? Hmmmmm...what is this world coming to? Oh, by the way, I was paid a decent compliment today. One of my friends (who laughed at the armidillo story) named Tonileigh said "Jenny (that's me) is weirder than the average Psycho." and " You think Jenny's weird? Wait till you see her in angry mob form!" Now THAT'S just weird. "angry mob form"? That just sounds nifty! I can clone myself and form and angry mob? In anycase, this was particularly funny because Tonileigh is one of my "normaler" friends. Although I tell you she can't possibly be normal, since she hangs out with me. Anyway, I'm gonna go. I gots stuff to do! I'm back. If you'll look toward the bottom of this page, you'll notice that I added a nifty little thing called the "babel fish". It will translate any thing, to anything else. Ain't it nifty? What's really fun is to translate an English saying, like out of sight, out of mind. Then, when it's in German, or whatever, translate it back to English. It's so completly garbled, it's funny. For instance, I wrote: "I am the Crazy Taco!", and translated it to German. I then copied and pasted the German and put it in the text box. I translated it from German to English and got "I am the Moved Taco!" See? Hours of completly useless fun! This has been my hourly Public Service Announcement that I only do when I feel like it. Seeya! I'm back! Woooo! And do I ever have a topic today! I've been a paranoid, conspiracy seeking mood lately and the newest threat to my sanity is: smoke detectors! Come on, think about it! In all those 911 shows, people wake up and their house is engulfed in flames. The smoke detector either never went off, or went off and the people just slept through it. Okay, fire is loud. And hot...and smoky. If you can sleep through a raging fire, close enough to set off the smoke detector, then you are definitly going to sleep through the smoke detector. Plus, the fire gradually gets louder, and hotter, and smokier. The sleeping person will gradually get used to it (and incorporate it into their dreams). By the time the smoke dector goes off, the fire has drowned it out to no more than an annoying buzz. My point is that smoke detectors have very little value in home security. Okay, one day, in the future, smoke dectectors will probably activate litte fire-fighter bots that every home will have. But untill that day, the concept of the smoke detector is useless. If you're awake to hear it, chances are that you've already noticed the smoke, fire and eminent danger. If you're asleep, the fire will wake you. So, that leads us to the evil paranoid conspiracy I thought of the other night. What if the smoke detectors have tiny litte cameras in them? That would explain that annoying green little blinkie light in them. Unless, of course, the government was smart enough to have cameras without the blinkie light. In any case, wouldn't the blinkie light help night-vision cameras see in the dark? It only takes a little light to help those thingies, and smoke detectors provide more than a little. I can even see the shadow of my hand on the wall from the light those things shed. It's annoying. Here I am, trying to get a decent nights sleep and there's this green light that periodically blinks to red directly in front of me. It's a small light, but it's sooooooo annoying. There MUST be some sort of conspiracy involved, 'cause if there is, I can get rid of the EVIL thing! So, fellow conspiracy nuts: Take down the evil governmental safety device and take it apart. If you can still think during all that incessent beeping, you'll probably find evidence that I'm really paranoid. Or possibly right...that would be scary. In any case...I guess that smoke detectors are a neccesary evil...but...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT STUPID LIGHT? Does it serve an obvious purpose? No! That's why it MUST be EVIL! You cannot deny the logic of my thinking! Now...I'm gonna go and worry about the light on my toaster oven...seeya! *sighs dramatically* I'm back. It's not fair, ya know? Each Friday, I wait (all tingly with anticipation) for the weekend so that I can stay up 'till the wee hours of the morning and sleep past noon. But my idiotic body has an automatic alarm clock, or something. During the weekdays, I get about seven hours of sleep (usually less) and wake up at 6:11 a.m. Yep. Now, some of you are probably calling me a whiner, 'cause you have to get up at 4:30, or whatever. And lots of you are probably gloating 'cause you don't have to get up 'till 8:30. The reason I have to get up at 6 something is that I...I...I ride the bus to school. Yeah...I know...pathetic. (Believe me, though, you never want to see me drive...I get easily distracted by clouds and signs saying FREE KITTIES!...kitties are hugable...but if you hug them...they'll scratch your eyes out...so then you have to hiss at them and establish dominence...but kitties don't like that...even though dogs do...but kitties are obviously not dogs...even though they are fuzzy.) So...my lack of a car and driving skills force me to use the bus, which comes for me 45 minutes before my school even starts. It's stupid. It only takes me a few minutes to get ready, then I can go back to bed. Now...I bet you're wondering why I don't just wake up a few minutes before I have to go. My sister. My evil, EVIL sister. That's why. She's evil. SHE has to get up at 6:11 to put on make-up, do her hair and basically annoy the heck out of me. So rather than battle her over the concept of getting dressed in the dark, I get up. Oh...I'm rambling again, aren't I? Back to the original topic! So...when the weekend rolls around, I'm fairly exhausted. But, my stupid internal alarm clock is starting to wake me up around six. I can usually fall back asleep (if I don't panic and think I'm late for school), but the stupid thing wakes me up again exactly seven hours after I originally fell asleep. Which is why it's not even 10:00 and here I am, typing. Which I suppose may be a good thing, seeing as how I'm currently in a Longest Text Ever Rivalry with Galaxy Dreamer's site. *cough*She's winning*cough* But that's just because I have so much to do to mantain and update this site, I rarely get a chance to just sit here and type. Oh, and I would like to mention to my *snicker* LOYAL fans that this Longest Text Ever DOES get updated at least once a week, so please, please, please, PLEASE do not read this once, in one sitting and then leave forever, and ever and ever! It makes me sad...*sniffle* Well...I feel better now. Did you know that I now possess a DOMAIN NAME? Yep. That's right! It'll be ready soon, ain't it great? Okay, back to the flaming-chickens LTE rivalry. Another reason why this isn't as long as Galaxy's is that I refuse to write every day as it would--this is the funny part--LOWER THE QUALITY OF MY OVERALL WORK! HA-HA! HILARIOUS! "lower the quality"? Sometimes I crack myself up. If this was quality work, I'd publish it and make a fortune. Speaking of publishing, I do plan on somehow, someday publishing this as the first rambling narrative that makes no sense, and is about as interesting as rereading the almanac. I'd probably lose money, but the concept is interesting. I think. Anyway, I better go or the quality of this will go down in that evil downward spiral thing I discussed a few months back. Seeya. I'm back. Wooooo! I's can get to my site again! It was down for a whole day or so 'cause of all the traffic I got from my new quizes. I have an extra-special rant for you all today, to celebrate the new domain name! www.flaming-chickens.com! Okay. I am now barophobic (afraid of gravity). I recently learned in my EVIL Physics class that on average, humans lose one inch of height during the day due to gravity pushing on their spine. The height is regained at night, when you're laying down. This naturally alarmed the HECK out of me! GRAVITY IS EVIL! It's pushing down on me, squishing my spine. MY SPINE IS SQUISHY! That's is just so extremly creepy. What if, eventually, Earth's gravity get's very very strong, and we all imploud from the squishyness? It'd be like when you go to the bottom of the ocean, only with gravity instead of pressure...*shudders* Pressure is evil, too. Air pressure. Did you know that there is over two miles of air sitting on you right now? Even though air is light, that much air adds up. TWO MILES? Even the air is conspiring to squish me! If you don't believe that all that air has weight, try going into space sometime. Space is notorious for not having air. When you're in space (without a space suit) you don't SUFFUCATE, you don't FREEZE. You exploud. Since all that nifty air isn't pressin' on you, your guts and stuff are free to go wherever they want, and the EVIL little things decide to roam around. Outside your body. It's creepy. So...air pressure can be a good thing. Even though it gains pleasure from squishing my spine. That's it, I'm gonna take drastic measures! I'm gonna launch THE OFFICIAL FLAMING CHICKENS LUNAR COLONY! The moon has one-sixth of Earth's gravity. And absolutly NO air-pressure. We can all wear spiffy space-suits and feel all superiour to all those stupid earthlings. So...if you wish to contribute to this great and magneficent and magestic and MOOSEY project...we need the following things: 739 rolls of aluminium foil (preferably the extra shiny kind) 417 refridgerator boxes, 9000 rolls of "sticky on both sides" duct tape, 300 lbs of chicken feathers (preferably white) and 1 (one) thermo-nuclear-rocket-thruster. If you can spare any of these items, please e-mail them to me. Yes. E-mail. Did you really think I'd give you guys my ADDRESS? Now...I know what you guys are thinking...some of those items on that list are gonna be hard to find. Especially that duct tape. But, believe me, it's MUCH more practical than the alternative. What is the alternative, you ask? I'll tell you. Making me(The Patron Saint of Paperclips) the Ruler of the Laws of Nature! That way I can just outlaw the need for gravity and air pressure! I'm already half way there, since I conclusivly proved (in Physics class) that gravity actually causes things to slow down and EVENTUALLY GO UP! Sure, my TEACHER said that was because I was doing the problems wrong, but once I'm the Ruler of the Laws of Nature, I'll change the problems so that I'm right! Oooo! I thought of another very good reason to assist with the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony! As we all know, the world is going to end in about 380,695 days! This means that we only have a very short while to prepare. And I sugest that we build the rocket so that we can go to the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony so that we can laugh at the stupid earthlings who are blowing up because they didn't listen to us when we tried to warn them about the impending doom! Once we are on our Lunar Landing Site, we will engage in many exciting activites, primarily related to suffucating and starving. If (and this is a big if) the world DOES survive, we can beg them for food, oxygen and other supplies. They'll probably just call us weird and laugh at us, but that's beside the point! I can even see the Official Flaming Chicken Rocket. It'll be covered in chicken feathers, and shaped like a chicken. The foil will make up the beak and the folded legs, and the thruster can simulate the tail. It will be a truly magestic site, as it launches from the earth, spewing excess oxygen, cardboard, feathers and tape. But, act now, or it will be too late, and you will be one of the losers that we'll be laughing at, assuming we have air to laugh with. Remember, e-mail psopc@flaming-chickens.com the much needed supplies...if that is possible. If not, then some day, when the Internet is down and I'm really bored, I will construct a model OFCR and attempt to launch it. That will be a wonderous day. I think I'll get my little sister to be the test piolet. Well...better go...I need to plan this out more...I'm back. And mildly weirded-out. My dad...was on this site. My dad. It even SOUNDS weird. He took the TAB member quiz and turned out to be me, he took the JOB quiz, and was a repo man (which had a pic of my brother) He said he wanted to see what I was doing, and to make sure that I wasn't saying anything derrogatory about my parents. He looked me upvia yahoo's search engine using flaming-chicken as the keyword. It took him to my quiz page. So he probably didn't see the majority of my site. It's just weird. All along, my entire family has scoffed (nifty word, isn't it?) about my site, and called me weird. I dunno...I guess I'm just kinda freaked out. Oh, and don't forget to celebrate Mad Hatter Day on October the 6th. Seeya. I'm back. I had some conspriacy or another to rant about. But then I listened to some of the new music I put on my site and mellowed out. I can't remember what I was gonna rant about. Oh, yeah. Now I do. "Purified" water. Just wait a sec while I stop the music. *content sigh* There we go...that's much better. Now I can think. That's right, folks. "Purified" water. Now...just stop a second and contemplate that. Pure means, well, no extra stuff. 100% of something. Right? Well, next time you buy your $3 FREAKIN' dollar bottle of water, consider this. On almost all the "purified" water bottles I've ever seen it has the following mesage: "Purified through reverse osmosis. Minerals added for a pure, fresh taste." In other words, they take all that extra "stuff" out to make it pure. Then they add other "stuff" in to make it TASTE pure. But it's not. For all you, the uninformed consumer, could know, it might have rat poison in it. "Pure" water manufactuerers are not required to list the ingredients of water, because the average consumer believes that it should be obvious. But that is false! They add random minerals to our water to make it taste better, and then advertise it as pure! It's an outrage! I'd rather drink the "impure" tap water where at least I KNOW that someone, somewhere tested it. It's a law, I think. But does anyone test "pure" water? Most likely they test it BEFORE they add the extra stuff..."Yep, Bob, this is some mighty pure water." "Yep, Bill, time to dump the arsnic in so it tastes pure!" What kind of reasoning is that? Wouldn't pure water TASTE pure, and impure water TASTE impure? The insanity and stupidity is mind boggling! That's why I like fast-food salt. It actually lists what random minerals they through in to make it TASTE like salt. There's salt, of course, and aluminum sulfate, and other compounds. But the point is, if I were, say, freakily allergic to a random mineral, I could read the ingredients and not eat the salt. That's what they need to do with the water. Or, at the very least, not label it as "pure". Okay. That's the rant of the week, month, year, whatever. I'll probably have another one soon, but that whole water thing has been buggin me for awhile. Well...seeya! Er...yeah...I'm back. It's been awhile, (at least two weeks) since I've written here. I've been obsessed with various webcomics, creating the stupidly long new Phobia Quiz and being maniacly hysterical about my site always being down due to bandwith issues. I'm goin' light on the advertising at the moment, which is why I'm free to write here. I WANT to write. But I can't think of anything to write about. Typical. I finnaly get some free time to rant and rave and all my topics just magically melted away. Let's see...what have I ranted about before, subliminal messages, vast breakfast cereal conspiracies, water, uh...reality tv? And that's just what I can list from memory. Oh, yeah! How could I forget the stupid Tootsie Roll Pop Commercials? TACO is still in my heart. *sighs*...now...let's see...what to rant about today... ... ... ... ... I can't think of anything!? Is this writer's block?! Or maybe I just wanna go to bed. Sleeping is fun. Well...let's see. Did you know that statistics prove that 45% of all statistics are completly made up by me (The Patron Saint of Paperclips)? Well...they are. Ha! I see you have no reaction to that, do you Hypothetical Reader? I have once again caused that explody sensation in your brain meats! You cannot DEFEAT me! I rule the...er...*random Loyal Minion whispers in ear* That's right! I rule the Internet! The Official FLaming-Chickens Handbook already confirms that fact! You CANNOT DENY it! It says that in black and...er lime green! It MUST be true! Because it is in those veyr colors that the Matrix is programmed! Ahhh...I see your confusion! You cannot follow the vast, mind-boggling logic that is ME! Wait...how...how can I BE logic? That doesn't make any sense...you can't BE something abstract...can you? Now MY brain meats feel explody. That's not fair! I see your EVIL plot now, Hypothetical Reader! You just let me rant on and on for you KNEW that eventually I would confuse myself with my vast puddle of knowledge. You are devious...I give you that. Unfortunantly...I must leave...before the confusion spreads and I do something stupid...like revealing my one weakness before you...THAT'S IT! Code 452 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paperclips (ME!!!) does not, has never, and will absolutly NOT admit to having any weakness...besides the aformention indivduals own skin, which isn't even a weakness anyway since no representative of the Dark, Fluffier Side can BE the Patron Saint of Paperclips (Guess, who...no...no...THAT'S IT!) and even if they could it wouldn't do them any good because it would scare them instead of the aformentioned individual. Boy...I really enjoy confusing myself!:) Seeya! I'm baaaaa-ack! Aren't you happy? Here, see if you can find the super-secret message!
        While you wait for yesterday's tomorrow, lunge back and remember that day.  You know the one.  Yeah, this doesn't mean anything to you.  Are you surprised?  Obviously not.  Answer me, you blobby looking freak! Or suffer my blindingly moronic nail messages.

        Did you find it? Wasn't it super? And secret? I thought it was. But then, I'm me...and you're you. I think. I'm pretty sure you're not me...but you could be that other guy. Yeah...that...guy...you know who I'm talking about. No? Do not MOCK me! I know where you are right now! Spooky, huh? Ooooo...time for today's topic. My favorite stuff...JTHM...I have my libraries copy of JTHM...I shall quote Noodle Boy for you:) (Full copyright/credit to Jonhnen Vasquez for writin' the stuff, I'm just sharing the spleeny goodness with you). (it's edited, of course, to stay PG13...**** signifies a random naugty word:)) "HEY, DOG ENTITY! RISE UP AND BARE YOUR BISCUIT FILTY FANGS AT THE LEASH WIELDING DEMON!! **** MY NAVEL ITCHES!! MEOW!MEOW!MEOW! CAT CHOW!!! CEASE YOUR FLATULENT WINDS AND HEAR MY MIND NUMBING EXPULSIONS OF WICKED NOISE! GRRR!! CHEESE!!! I SENSE YOUR ENVY OF MY NECK!! AND I DONT BLAME YOU!! DROOOOOL OVER MY MAGICAL POWERS!! I HAVE POWERS PINTO BEANS CAN ONLY DREAM OF! WANNA SEE ME PULL A TAPEWORM OUTTA MY ****!! HUH?!...STARE DEEP INTO THE STINKING ABYSS OF MY INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED SLICES!!! HOLY WAX! CHECK OUT MY ARMPITS!!! HEEEEY! WAIDAMINIT!! WAIT JUST A POLYP PICKING MINUTE!! I SEE YOUR GAME! YOU WILL NOT SINK MY CHEERIO!! I SEE WHAT IS TRANSPIRING HERE!!! YOU'RE ALL ZOMBIE THIGH-FAT PEOPLE BROUGHT INTO ANIMATION BY SOME EVIL FORCE OF FORCEFUL EVIL!!! **** THAT LIPSTICKS THE WRONG COLOR FOR YOU!! MOOOO! WOOF! OH, DON'T YOU SEE THE TOENAILS?!! OH, SO SPLENDID!! A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K...! UNDER SUCH EXTREME HEAT, WEAR AND DEGRADATION IS INEVITABLE!! PARTS BREAK AFTER OVERUSE!! AND THAT IS WHY TOASTER PASTRIES WILL BURST INTO FLAMES IF YOU DON'T KEEP AN EYE ON THEM! Now, wasn't that entertainment. I added to the lenghth of the LTE without even thinking! That's talent. Lots of gooey talent. Unfortunatly, I once again am devoid of a topic. And any weirdness I could come up with would be normal compared to Noodle Boy, so...I bid thee farewell...seeya! I'm back. And I've realized that I am a complete idiot. For an ENTIRE MONTH I have possesed the arcane knowledge, but I forgot to share it with you, my loyal potentially imaginary reader. I know. You're shocked at my selfish, bad, memory. I apologize from the depths of my moosey soul. For, you see...my life long goal has been fufilled...*anticipatory silence*...THERE ACTUALLY IS GRAPE PIE!!!! I know...you are as shocked as I am. One day I was randomly looking up images via Google...and 'lo and behold, there it was. Grape Pie. It was as if it had been just sitting there...waiting for me to discover it. Apparantly Grape Pie isn't mainstream, but it has existed for some time. In obscure cookbooks. Well...that just makes me filled with gooey happiness. Of course, there is also regret...after all, I could have made a fortune if I'd been the first to think of it. Oh, well. There was something else I had to tell you loyal *cricket chirps, someone coughs* fans. I can't remember what. I guess I'll just rant and rave about that whole vicious downward spiral of my writing. I mean, I KNOW people are coming here...I have proof! *holds up a piece of paper, which, from a distance, appears to have writing on it* Yes, undenyable proof! But this proof degrades this mysterious, mystical and mystifying "quality" of my words. After all, how can I be self derisive, and full of low expectations for this site if I KNOW people are here...several thousand of them in fact, in just a few months. It's strange. I felt more fufilled when this site was a barren wastland of useless space. But, if it had remained that way, I would have had no impetus to continue my pointlessly insane ranting. Oh, speaking of insane, I STILL need those much needed supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! No one has even bothered to e-mail them to me...*sniffle*. I needs the duct tape! How can I survive without the sticky goodness? HOW, I ask you!? It cannot be...hmmmm...maybe I should just use IMAGINARY duct tape...it's easier to come by ,but it's much more expensive...I'm not sure what to do. *enter Squirell* What's that, little Squirell? That's just silly. You KNOW I ran out of imaginary money last week when I bought that imaginary country. WHAT!? Just "imagine" I have more!? What a crazy idea. So crazy it just might work! *scrunches eyes and makes funny sounds* Nope. It didn't. I guess I'll just have to wait untill my imaginary clone hijacks that imaginary bank truck. Until then...I have absolutly no imaginary money. What ever shall I do? I won't be able to feed my various imaginary pets and friends their beloved imaginary food! Squirell? You gots extra money, don't you? *nods* I thought so. You give to me? No? I gives you imaginary IOU's...here...yours. Thank you Squirell. *Squirell wanders off in search of electrical sockets to sniff* What's that, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know who Squirell is? You haven't been paying attention have you? She's my little puppy...she fears grape flavored stuff, wind, rain, television, noise, silence, small children and pretty much everything. She likes sniffing potentially dangerous stuff, like electrical sockets. Surely you have heard of her? Still no? Oh, well. You know...I enjoy having these conversations with you. It really lets me get to know you. What's that? You say I'm really just talking to myself? What an eccentric idea! To think, YOU are trying to tell ME that YOU aren't here. How absurd. After all, I'm talking to you, aren't I? *nods* Well, yeah...I KNOW I'm actually typing instead of talking. Wait a minute...so you're saying that I'm talking and responding to you, but you won't be reading this until long after I have finished typing? Now who's the crazy one? For that theory to work, I'd have to be psychic...or in possesion of a freaky time-traveling computer. Because what you're saying is that I'm talking to people in the future. That my words somehow travel accross time (if only a few minutes) and are somehow picked up by future you, and that my responses are dictated by future you's reactions. What? You mean that I'm just randomly responding regardless of your reactions? Why, that would be insane, wouldn't it? That's the point you're trying to get across? *pauses* Oh. I see. You wanna play that way. Well...two can play by THOSE rules. You wanna try to convince me I'M crazy? Well, look at you? How do you know I even exist? For all you know you could be staring at that freaky 3-D maze screen saver with a blank look on your face while you THINK you're reading an inhumanly long text. For all you know, you could be halucinating my entire site! For that matter, how do you know that ANYTHING but you exists! You could be floating out in empty space, conjuring nice little fantasies to relieve the monotony of being the only living being! Every single person you know could just be figments of your imagination, you could even be in a crazy house! Not only that, but how do you know that YOU actually exist? You could be the figment of someone else's dream. What would happen when that dreamer woke? Are you happy? You got me started. I may NEVER shut up. I'll just go on and on about how crazy you COULD be. All because YOU tried to convince me that I was crazy. *blinks* And I STILL can't remember what else I was gonna say to you people. Strange, huh? Well, I better leave before I go on and on about more "reality" theories. Makes you wonder about "reality" television, huh? Seeya. I'm back. Grrrr...I had a nifty rant all planned out in my head. And then I was unable to get on the computer and I forgot most of it. Oh, but I did remember what else I wanted to say to you people. Remember that rant I did on how there could be a secret camera in the smoke detector? I few months ago I saw a movie about that. It was pretty good. Maybe I'd seen it before, and that's where I got the idea. I forgot it's name. Well...I DO have a special treat for you weirdos who apparantly like wasting time! Today, in my (Honors) English class, we did group work. My group...well...we either went hysterical or crazy, I can't decide which. We had to do an essay on a book. There was a sample essay online. It sucked. It tooked about envelooping (enveloping) cracked nuts and parables. So we were already off to a bad start. Here is the sum total of my group's work. (Note: I wrote virtually none of this, so I cannot be blamed, credited with any of this. "Lots of death, lots and lots of death in this section. Death is like life in that after you die some things start life again inside of you. 'Ah the power of cheese!' The author's vision was unique in that only he put biscuits and death in the same sentence. 'I found nothing else to do but to offer him on of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket'" And we're supposed to be GOOD in English! We KNEW how terrible it was, but we just didn't bother to change it. Especially the part about the biscuits and cheese. We just picked random words in the selection and wrote about them. It was sad. In any case, I hope you enjoyed our patheticness. Seeya! I'm back. Today I will be mercifully brief. I am here to bring AWARNESS to your moosey soul! Right now, while you are sitting in your "chair" and eating your "junk food", millions of almonds are commiting suicide. Yes...that's right...suicide. I was alerted to this growing problem in our world community by (Kat, the ruler of all that is almondy)...and it greatly concerns me. People just don't realize that their almonds and mixed nuts may be having depression and other problems. We need to act now! For more information, e-mail EnpuUnknown@msn.com Well...seeya! I'm so very, very tired. Today was Halloween. I worked for four hours at the "Library of Terror" sponsered by TAB. TAB members got pizza...lots of pizza...and candy. Ugh. It was fun, but exhausting. I was almost completly covered in (fake) blood...it was sticky toward the end. One guy was a "shock therepy" patient...he was a good actor. He acted like he was really being tortured and stuff. I'm tired. I bet you couldn't tell. Why am I writing? Because this is the first time I've been on a computer all day. You can't blame me. Don't worry, I'll go to bed soon. In the mean time, I'll just sit here and type with my eyes closed. It's hard to type because of the bandaid on my finger. I accidently cut it with scizzors. It hurt. The fake blood seeped into the open wound. Gee...I sure hope it wasn't poisonous. If so, I guess I won't be writing here for quite awhile...seeya. Okay, this next rant has nothing to do whatsoever with Halloween...which is to be expected because it's been several days since then. Anyway, today's rant is about one of my many and various pet peeves: fasion and...stuff. My definition of fasion includes clothes, shoes, jewelery and all things of that nature. Now, don't get me wrong. I can appreciate a spiffy black outfit as much as the next person, but everytime I consider actually buying clothes for aesthetic value, I think about how I could better spend my money. On video games. Sure, some of this "fasion" stuff is cool and all, but all it shows is that you had the three and three-quarters brain cells required to copy someone else's "look". And don't even get me started on earrings. My little, eviler sister got her ears pierced when she was relativly younger. My mom did it to her because it was free. OF FREAKIN' COURSE IT WAS FREE! Just like thos so called "diet supplements" that give you a "free" sample because they know that once you try it, you'll like it so much you'll spend oodles of cash on it. (There's probably drugs in it). Anyway, like the "diet supplement" people, the earring manufacturers KNOW that once they pierce you, you'll be hooked for life. *pauses* *groans* I'm sorry for that pun (pierced, hooked, getit?). AS soon as you're pierced, you have to buy "starter" earrings. Then you'll need an "extra" pair...for special occasions. Before you know it you'll realize that you need Christmas earrings, Halloween earrings, Valentine's Day earrings, St. Patrick's Day earrings, for crying out loud! You'll wear these "festive" earings for about a day and then abandon them in some dark cranny of your closet because you simply can't wear the same earrings two years in a row for heaven's sake! Then you'll see these cute little "days-of-the-week" earrings at the mall, and you'll just have to get a few sets, just in case you lose some. By the time you're eighty, you'll have enough ear jewelry to open up your own jewelry shop. Of course, you won't want to do that becuase you still need more earrings so people won't think you wear the same ones over and over again. When I think of how much money people WASTE on appearences, it makes me feel like projectile vomiting. If that's not a vast conspiracy, then nothing on this Earth is. Now, I'm not speaking from personal experience here. No one I know is that obsessed with earrings, it was just an example. (Although my mother does have a "earring tree".) Sure, certain members of my family do pay WAY to much attention to fasion, but that's just because of the expectations of society. I, being weird, am pretty much immune to such expectations. Except those specially formulated for weird-o's like me. If I were to suddenly convert this entrie site into a *shudders* Backstreet Boys fan site or something, you wouldn't be any more suprised than I would be if my brother woke up one day and suddenly realized that he's shallow. It's the same concept. (No, I don't like any of those creepy "pop" stars. I think that they should routinly die a slow, savage, agonizing death...I was just saying a random thing that I would never, ever do.) Well...any way...seeya! I'm back. And today's rant is a sort of philosophical one. It's about the (supposedly) infinite nature of the universe. Suprised? It's spiffy. You see, if the universe is indeed infinite, that means that literally EVERYTHING is possible, and in fact, is happening somewhere in the universe. Think about it. No matter how unlikely something is, if the universe is infinite, it's happening an infinite number of times. Think about that old saying about "If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, eventually they would reproduce the entire works of Shakespear". That makes complete and total sense! Anyone just randomly typing letters will eventually accidently write a word, right? Now think of 100 people typing randomly. You figure that one of those 100 people would actually have a coherent phrase. And one out of a million people would probably have a few sentences. So if you have an infinite number of people, some are going to have entire books of coherent stuff. And, you have to remember that because infinity is infinite, you can divide it an infinite number of times. Try it. If you have a decent graphing calculator, plug in the infinity symbol divided by anything, (even infinity). The answer is still infinity. Using my philosopy, that EVERYTHING exists because the universe is infinite...well...think about it. In some far off world, there are pokemon...there are an evil race of muffin like creatures, there is a world with ABSOLUTLY NO COMMERCIALS DURING TELEVISION! I know, unlikely, huh? But somewhere, it exists. Think about it. If the universe is infinite it would be crazy to think that we're alone. With an infinite universe, there are infinite possibilites. There ARE aliens. Not only that, but there are an infinite number of different kinds of intelligent life. Which means that there are an infinite number of worlds with humanoid life. (Think of the fake-looking Star Trek aliens). If there are an infinte number of worlds with human life, than there are an infinte number of worlds that have someone exactly like you, with only a few key differences. (Like alternate dimensions and stuff) So, there is a world where you are the creator of this Longest Text Ever. There is a world where you are a faerie. There is a world where you were never born. There is a world where you are a slave to your TOASTER OVEN. The possibilities are literally endless. Every fantasy the human mind has concieved exist at some place in the universe. There are an infinite number of worlds with Harry Potter. Think about it. I came up with this philosophy when I was in fifth grade. I'd tell it to my little brother as a bed time story. He always enjoyed it because it meant that somewhere, he was the Supreme Dictator of the Galaxy. That made him happy. He ignored the fact that he was also a 72 year old "sanitation engineer" somewhere. All the good possibilities effectivly cancel out the bad ones, leaving the sum total of you and your counterparts experiences as nothing. You don't have the best life of your counterparts, but you don't have the worst either. Because that would be impossible. There is always someone worse off and better off than you. Because there are an infinite number of people on either side of the spectrum. Confusing, huh? But that's the kind of thing I like. That also explains why normal stuff confuses me. I'm sure some so called "scientist" can prove all my theories wrong...but how? How do you PROVE something is not infinite? You'd have to find the end, of course. But how, may I ask, can you find the end of the FREAKIN' universe? What, is there a giant sign saying, "DEAD END"? The universe is EVERYTHING, how can it end? At the same time, how can you prove something IS infinite? You could travel in a straight line at the speed of light for a million years and all you'd prove is that the universe is really, really big. But you'd never prove it was infinite. How could you? Our mind's cannot conceive of the vastness of infinity. We'd probably go crazier. In any case, my theory means that playing video games is very cruel. Why, you ask? Because in some world, the video game is real. So when you kill, or whatever, in the game, you are actually ending life somewhere in the universe. Of course, you also end life by sneezing, eating, sleeping, and watching T.V. According to my theory that everything is real. Of course, if everything is real...then the Universe is pretty contradictory. The paradox of my system of beliefs leads me to believe that the universe, in fact, is not infinite. Because nature supposidly abhors a paradox. Although, as I said, there's no way to prove me wrong OR right. That's what I like about making abstract theories... Anyway, sorry for the lack of relative weirdness, conspiracy theories and doughnuts (my Moose ate them all). Well...now that I think about it...according to my theory, ALL conspiracies are real and mislabled "paranoid" people are really the only ones who see the truth. *blinks* Wow...so I'm NOT paranoid. Who'da thought it? Well...better go before one of my two and half sane readers falls asleep:) Seeya! I'm back! Boy, are you mythical, mystical readers in for a treat, today! I have a guest rant/fake commercial written by "Meg" (who is once again banned from accessing the almighty Internet). Are you ready? No? Too Bad! The magic eight-ball glows with knowledge! With a shake, the future is revealed! The magic eight-ball is a plastic casing with an unknown, possibly toxic liquid inside. The future is determined by the triangles, in a startling blue color which spin around in a zany manner. Wheather you're saved or doomed, find out now! Is that old lady on the street corner really an ex-convict? Is fat-free food more delicious than food loaded with fat? Is your school playground a gateay to the underworld? All this information and more is yours for the low, low price of 5 payments of $29.99! And, if you call within the next ten minutes you get a free eight ball with the one you buy! But wait! There's more! Get the free Lil' Ball for your traveling needs! Warning: this product is illegal in most states) Wasn't that entertaining? "Meg" wrote it for a school assignment. We were supposed to write about a cherished child-hood toy, and attempt to turn our fond memories into a commercial. I wrote about furby, and how it was fun to watch it die. No, really. Somehow, I managed to make my furby die. It would sneeze, then start it's eight-hour-long death hum. It would hum, and hum, and hum...and then mercifully die. I don't exactly have a good track record with virtual pets. I once...*embarassed pause* had "Hey, You! Pikachu!"...a pokemon game. I'll only say that it was the first game you could "talk" to and was the first (and only) N64 virtual pet. Pikachu...well...he didn't like me. I gave him cupcakes, and presents, and did everything I could to befriend him! And what did he do to me? He snuck up on me one day in our room (in the game) with a sword! That's right, a sword! He tried to kill me! I heard something and turned around, and there he was! He even tried to hide the sword behind his back! When I tried to talk to him, he tossed it away nonchalantly and pretended he hadn't heard me. Then he preceeded to trash my room, scattering kleenex everywhere. I'm pretty sure that the "smelly yellow ball" that he started throwing was his own feces (poo). That dirty little rat. Awwww...isn't he cute? Hmmmm...I suppose I should clarify that the Pikachu game was 3-D and your character was in first person mode(you see through character's eyes). Otherwise you'd think I was delusional, or something. Everyone I know who has played that game is shocked when I tell them...oh, well. Speaking of virtual pets, I'm revamping the ones on this site. I've finnally figured out sorta, maybe, kinda, how to do stuff to make it more real. Anyway, seeya! OOooooo! I'm back, and I had yet another Asparagus War with some people. We made a guild, and I wrote out the transcripts of the first ever Asparagus War in narrative form (mock epic, very cheesey) Since it's very, very long, I'll post it here to meet my imaginary word quota for the day! Oh, and all those weird squiggly lines and symbols, those are supposed to be apostrophes, but neopet's code is weird, and I'm not gonna bother to edit it. Enjoy!
        And, on the 15th day of the Month of August, in the year of our Lord 2003, at approximately 7:52 p.m. a great and wondrous battle was fought in the waste lands of the General Chat Room. â€˜Lo, and eon337 did wield the mighty Swiss-Asparagus, and did attempt to vanquish her foe, the Evil and Fluffy preggypreggy. Preggypreggy had tamed the fearsome Asparagus Sword, and many a foe had she slain with her valor. But behold! For the Swiss-Asparagus did slice, and dice and was capable of turning itself into julienne fries! And so it seemed that the two mighty warriors were evenly matched and that their struggle would never come to and end. They didst charge at each other with a terrible noise and clamor, and the skies did shake and the earth did tremble at the ferocity of their mighty blows! The stereotypical Asparagus Sword didst fail to hit its mark and eon337 did mock the Sword for itâ€™s falling.

        Translation: On 8-15-03, 7:52 NST, eon337 and preggypreggy grabbed some Asparagus Themed weapons and fought. They made fun of each otherâ€™s weapons, and generally kept missing each other every time they swung.
        And eon337 did think long and ponderous and in so doing converted the puny Swiss-Asparagus into the mighty and powerful toothpick. And the masses did gleam the significance of this act and they were awed by the grace and cunning of the wooden speck. And preggypreggy was immune to the verbal slings and arrows of her foe, and refused to be disheartened by eon337â€™s dishonorable insults. Her claim being that function of a weapon is to be put before the ornate form. She endeavored to thwart eon337â€™s plans to defeat her with the great and wondrous toothpick. She didst again pummel the air with her sword, but in her enthusiasm her blows didst fall far from their mark. And the masses didst cheer for eon337 as she had impressed them greatly and they made the sounds of impressive wonder.
        Translation: Eon337 turned a perfectly good Swiss-Asparagus into a toothpick to gain the approval of the studio audience. The audience oooed and awed. Preggypreggy continued to swing wildly around, missing each time. She ignored eon337â€™s insult and said that at least her sword worked.
        And then a new challenger didst arrive at the arena and scoobychick6900 didst fling bowls of asparagus at the fighting mortal enemies. Preggypreggy appealed to the masses, but to no avail, and was heartily surprised when the asparagus did hit her. And â€˜Lo! The masses didst condemn scoobychick6900 loudly and vehemently and there was much rejoicing in the land. Preggypreggy didst fancy that she had perhaps met scoobychick6900 previously, and so did attempt to recollect when. Eon337 did take advantage of the lull in action and did attack preggypreggy with her finger. Preggypreggy did retaliate with the awe-inspiring SuperPoke, and eon337 was laid low upon the ground in agony.
        Translation: Scoobychick6900 showed up and threw bowls of asparagus. Eon337 poked preggypreggy, and preggypreggy poked back, harder. Eon337 was hurt.
        And with victory in her mighty vision, preggypreggy didst decide to reveal her secret weapon, and with a fancy hand movement, revealed the extent of her traitorous ways. For all know that the bagels and the doughnuts didst disband in ancient times of old. Preggypreggy, through her treacherous methods, had obtained the Flying Doughnut of Doom and didst endeavor to use it. Eon337 was readily prepared for such an occurrence and didst arm herself with mighty ear-shields, armor that didst repel all projectiles of metal, a head covering, and an outer covering of strange, transparent material that didst snap whence it was squeezed. Aragorns_cutie then didst show up with the almighty nemesis broccoli and an unnecessary sneer upon her countenance. _Radical_girl_ did break the protocol and didst claim to rather fight with cucumbers, and so it was done. And the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst not hear the newcomers because of her mighty ear-shields, and didst offer the fighters dressings for their wounds.
        Translation: Preggypreggy revealed that she had a secret weapon from Ancient Times, although eon337 was prepared for it, with earmuffs, bulletproof armor, and bubble wrap. Two new fighters showed up and did random things. Eon337 offered Band-Aids.
        And aragorns_cutie didst laugh in a manic way, and didst wave the broccoli to and fro in a threatening manner. And eon337 did finally recognize the newcomers, and ask, neigh, commanded they give preggypreggy healing strips. And _radical_girl_ didst howl furiously and implored the fighters to meet their DOOOOOOOOM. And so hiamplidude didst come to the battle and didst posses the almighty Asparagus Cannon, and did thinkest himself invincible. Following himaplidude camst nemmisis_dude, who didst offer the warriors ponderous messages such as: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN 10 DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME. And the warriors didst consider nemmisis_dude a profit, who was devoted to speaking in tongues so as to convey a message from the gods. And â€˜Lo! Nemmisis_dude didst reveal his Bow and Asparagus and the masses rejoiced. And eon337 didst intimidate her foes by snapping her transparent covering and shrieking that she was invincible.
        Translation: Random stuff happened, and more people showed up. Someone spammed the message board so people ignored it and eon337 went crazier
        And â€˜Lo! The writer of this cheesy epic didst realize that virtually every sentence begins with â€œandâ€, and the masses rejoiced. _radical_girl_ didsâ€™t chase random people with her broccolis, and didst miss in her mighty swings. Hiamplidude didst take out nemmisis_dude, and gloried in his honor and didst receive a spinach gun from the gods. . Preggypreggy was threatened by the randomness, and didst call her secret weapon, the Mighty Evil Flying Donut Of Doom! Eon337 realized preggypreggyâ€™s unprecedented treachery and didst cower in her impotence before one so Dark and Fluffy. And aragorns_cutie had ex-lax and _radical_girl_ didst covet invincibility and so did don a pool covering. Nemmisis_dude was revealed to be unharmed by hiamplidude, and didst fire at preggypreggy with an asparagus gun. But preggypreggy didst forget one thing: eon337 still possessed the support of the ignorant masses, which guaranteed her inevitable victory. And preggpreggy scoffed at eon337â€™s supposed advantage and didst claim that even the ravenous horde of the people didst not conceive of her one vulnerable point. And preggypreggy didst close her mind to the truth: the dark side is fluffy.
        Translation: Preggypreggy called the Flying Donut of doom and eon337 called preggypreggy a traitor. The newcomers did random tings, and eon337 reminded everyone that she still had the support of the studio audience. Preggypreggy refused to see it as an advantage, and refused to believe that she was on the Dark, Fluffier Side.
        And behold, for eon337 didst transform the Asparagus Toothpick into a Aspara-Launcher and didst call preggypreggy deceived in her way of thinking, for the Dark Side is always Fluffier. And preggypreggy didst call forth the creamed cheese from the bowels of the Evil Flying Donut of Doom and the masses did rejoice, and wallowed in the fattening substances that fell from the air like a gift of mana from the gods. And eon337 didst fire projectiles at preggypreggy and unexpectedly mimicked the holy Matrix in her cries of â€œDodge thisâ€. And neoshadow08 didst arrive and inquire as to whether rubber chickens were allowed, and the multitudes said yes. Preggypreggy, in her infinite wisdom, failed to see the connection between Darkness and Fluffiness, and was so forsaken by the masses. And greyratt didst claim to have invented a new, spookier type of asparagus that never caught on, and the multitudes rejoiced. Preggypreggy didst dodge the projectile, and gained honor amongst the masses. As the theological debate about the Dark, Fluffier Side raged on, the newcomers fought with the dung of dogs, the chickens of rubber and other such unorthodox weaponry as greyratt didst play with discarded asparagus.
        Translation: Some stuff happened here. No, really! Eon337â€™s toothpick became an Aspara-Launcher, and preggypreggy and eon337 argued about whether the Dark Side was Fluffy or not. Neoshadow08 and greyratt came, and did stuff. Preggypreggy released cream cheese from the Flying Donut of Doom.
        And eon337 didst revealth that she didst posses the Ultimate Asparagus Themed Weapon, too terrible to be named, oh, what the heckth, the name didst ring and was The Thermo-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And preggypreggy didst begin to crack under the strain of the Squeak of Death, and so in his infinite understanding, neoshadow08 didst remove the Squeak of Death and didst replace it with the Chic Attack. Aragorns_cutie didst protest the violence, and didst consume the flavorful tomato paste. And moonbeam998 didst come, a magical priestess full of arcane knowledge. Her mighty glance didst fall upon the warriors and she didst proclaim: THIS TRULY WORKS! POST THIS IN TEN DIFFERENT BOARDS AND YOU WILL FIND A BABY PAINTBRUSH WHEN YOU GO TO CHAT PREREFERENCE AND 10000000000NPS! THIS TRULY WORKS, TRUST ME! And the warriors were mystified by her meaning, but verily they didst decide that it meant for them to continue their holy battle, in the name of whatever great and mysterious god moonbeam998 didst represent. Scoobychick6900 didst return to pummel the warriors with bowels of asparagus, as in times of old.
        Translation: Eon337 got out the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon, and neoshadow08 stopped squeaking and started the Chick Attack. Yet another person spammed the message board, and was equally ignored. Scoobychick6900 returned.
        And neoshadow08â€™s baby chickens didst fall unto the warriors from the sky, and didst pummel the brave fighters unmercifully. And scoobychick6900 didst offer to the warriors magical rainbow colored pellets, which she didst hurl at them forcefully with a gun. The magic pellets were then revealed to be the chickenâ€™s only weakness. And the warriors were locked in a deadly struggle, each using their unique methods and weapons. And the masses didst rejoice yet again. And then â€˜Lo! For preggypreggy was forced to valiantly flee the battlefield, and acceded the victory to eon337. And the masses looked confused. Eon337 didst admit that preggypreggy didst fight a valiant battle. Skuld815 didst arrive and didst proclaim the battle strange and didst fling M & Mâ€™s at the warriors. And scoobychick6900 didst proclaim that Rice Krispies were much more powerful than other weapons, and didst think that she was the only warrior left. She did wail with despair as she didst discover that eon337 remained in the land of the living.
        Translation: Neoshadow08 caused chickens to fall from the sky, and scoobychick6900 fired skittles at people. Preggypreggy had to leave, and skuld815 showed up. Scoobychick6900 thought she was the last fighter left, but was not.
        And eon337 and scoobychick6900 were locked in a deadly struggle, candy versus vegetables. And neoshadow08 didst summon the Great Banana for advice, and the masses were stunned. Oh, the ground did shake, and the mountains trembled. The very stars became irregular in their rotations. And so the Great Banana was called, and it was good. And scoobychick6900 revealed that she had indeed blasphemed against the Great Banana and she didst quake in terror and attempted to corrupt eon337 into blaspheming as well. And shadow9441414 didst arrive with two prodigious asparagus swords. And spicychibie didst arrive and was proven to be crazier than all others, and the masses were impressed. Behold! Eon337 didst prostrate herself before the might of the Great Banana and didst beg for his aid in defeating scoobychick6900, and the Great Banana didst forgive eon337 and giveth her a banana. And spicychibie didst partake of the asparagus and didst faint. And the Great Banana didst advise eon337 to not rely on the strength of others, but to rely on the strength within. And scoobychick6900 didst appeal to the Great Banana and didst beg for forgiveness. And the Great Banana didst not make a reply, but instead didst close his eyes and did a perfect mimicry of sleep. And scoobychick6900 didst blasphemy again and didst explode bombs of rainbow color. And eon37, in the callow impatience of youth, didst detonate the Thermal-Asparagus-Nuclear-Weapon. And the masses were blown away. As the smoke, and rubble and debris were dissipated, behold! The Great Banana was vanquished! And eon337 didst lament this fate, for her weapon hadst been aimed at scoobychick6900. And scoobychick6900 didst revel in the defeat of the Great Banana, and didst stab at eon337 with its decapitated stem. And neoshadow08 was forced to choose sides, and â€˜Lo he choose eon337! And the warriors didst depart, if not friends, then less angry enemies. And so ends the first of: The Asparagus Wars Chronicles.
        Translation: While eon337 and scoobychick6900 fought, neoshadow08 called the Great Banana. Scoobychick6900 claimed to have eaten the banana the previous night, and feared the bananaâ€™s wrath. The Great Banana was defeated, and everyone decided that the war was over.
        Wasn't that entertaining? Seeya! I'm back! Woooooooooooo! Guess what? Yep! *happy wiggle dance* I gots the first shipment of the much needed (pictures of) supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! Woooooo! I feels the happy! This has been a short announcment to document the happy wigglienss that is me. Seeya! I'm back. And vaguely depressed. For the longest time, random people have been coming to my site, and staying 0.00 seconds! How is this possible? Do they not even look at my site? How can they be so cruel, to click, but not look? Grrr.... I asked Santa why this was so...but he doesn't talk to me anymore, after that incident when I was a kid. You see...*start wavy flashback lines and dreamy music* When I was a kid...or whatever...I asked Santa for nuclear warheads, helicopters, tanks...and possibly legions of doom. No, seriously! (I was twelve and forced to communicate with Santa so that my younger siblings did not guess the truth...(what truth?)...there is no spoon. (badly done Matrix parody)) Anyway...Santa didn't come through. The creep! How was I supposed to conquer the world without those supplies? All I got was a Lion King video and other random stuff. How did this help me? I vowed revenge against Santa...after all, it would have benefited him to help me. Once I was the Undisputed Lord of the Universe, the world would have been a spooky place. And all the little children wouldn't have been "good" anymore, since they would be free of thier Authoritarian Parental Units and the definition of "good" (to a parent, at least) is to obey your parents and not embarrass them. Soooooo....Santa would have had it easier. No "good" children would have meant that Santa could have had a permanent vacation in the Bahahmas, not molested by my Legions of Doom because after all--he had delivered the world to me in a brightly wrapped gift box. The man would have been more trusted than my trusted Lieutenants! (funny word...had to use spell check to spell it ^^;;) But that jolly old IDIOT had to mess things up. So, to get back at him I not only continued to not believe in him, I attempted to convert all the miniony children at my disposal...(okay not really, the idea just occured to me)...so I ask you *cough* Loyal Reader, to immediatly cease believing in Santa. I figure that--like Tinkerbell--he will evenutally perish if he doesn't have enough people believing in him. What is this? You wish to rule the world, too? Well, you can't! It's mine! Blasphemy! You dare to challenge MY rule? You are a fool! Okay...yeah...my whole Santa plot IS kinda dumb...but that's just a front so that you never guess my REAL plot! That's right....cower before my power! *insert evil, insane cackle here* I shall defeat you, Anonymous (another tricky word) Reader! Gah! I'd better go before you trace my location thorugh the Internet and send your Governmental Spyders to me! Ooops...I gave you an idea, didn't I? Well, don't use it! It's mine, you are a copy cat! Seeya *appropriate evil glare* I'm back! And, seeying as you MUST be tired of MY ranting, I have a special treat for all you hypothetical two and a half readers out there! You get ranting from somebody else! I won't bother to introduce them, since they do a good job of it themselves...here we go: Hiya. This is not PSOPC today. This is PSOCB (Patron Saint of Carbonated Beverages). We are the two original Head Saints, but for some reason, she gets all the attention. Guess I should get out of bed once in a while huh. Originally, I thought up the whole Patron Saints of the Order of the Flaming Chicken (when I should have been taking notes in Trig), but PSOPC is more creative and she elaborated on it more so. I was drawing "suppressed rage in bunny form" comics then and didn't care. I must say, she's gotten very good at thinking randomy thoughts, whereas, I'm just stoopid and something dumb pops out of my brain like floppy bacon from a toaster. I drank half a bottle of soy sauce today just to see if it gave me x-ray vision, but alas, I had nothing I wanted to look through (okay, I'm lying. I drank the whole thing on a dare.). By the way, soy sauce is gross. Who invented it? --"Why gee whiz, Bert! I think we should mix soy beans with water and have chinese for lunch!!"--"Why, indubitoubly Samson! Not only will it taste like crap, we'll get the runs!!!"-- If you don't know what the "runs" are, consult old people, like my dad. If you are in high school or college and have a job, this works great. When I call in sick (when I'm sick of working, not actually sick), I always have nosey bosses who want to know exactly what my symptoms are and how bad. I found a way to make them not WANT to know. I told my sister to try it once and it worked for her too. You just call up work, use a very retarded, slow, lisping voice when you say this: --"Weeelllllllll, I woked up this mornin' with a terrible headache so I took some aspirin with theraflu. By the way, those don't mix too good, now I have a tummy ache, my nose is runny and bleedin', my spleen feels like its gonna 'splode, I'm a tad gassy, and I got the RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!-- At this point, you'll want to use an annoying high-pitched growly voice (think drunk Barney from The Simpsons after sucking helium balloons), raspberry a few times with your toungue and hang up. I have much to do now, so thus ends this portion of my guest rant. I'll probably want to do this a few more times just because I can. Weeee Bye now! I bet you, loyal *hmmm...I don't want a cricket...maybe a nice annoying gnat or something...okay...instead of the cricket...* readers can't wait for the next time I don't rant! Right? Weeeellll...I DO have a topic for today...a topic so wonderful that it will also be included in the next OFCEM! What is this magical topic, you ask? Why, opposite day, of course! You see...er...well...how should I begin? Opposite day is, of course a day in which everything you say means the exact opposite. It is practiced (informally) by many elementary schoolers. I honor this er...honored tradition. But, to my dismay, I discovered a fatal flaw with opposite day. By my reasoning...it COULD NOT EXIST! Yes...I know...blasphemy, right? But it could not be disputed. If you were to tell someone that it WAS opposite day they would have to take the opposite of what you just said which would mean that it WASN'T opposite day. And, of course, if you were to tell someone that it WASN'T opposite day there would be no reason for them to take the opposite of what you said and so it still WOULDN'T be opposite day! Confusing, huh? But I have now seen the light! The answer to this moral dilema has been so neatly resolved, by Jesse. He is er...well...I'm not sure how old...but he is in the third grade. He is either a genius...or really weird like me (Come on, be honest...how many of you random people have put any though into opposite day...or even know about it?) He said that to make it opposite day...*dramatic pause in which the PSOPC stares into space vacantly*...all you had to do was say that it would be opposite day in 5 seconds! PURE GENIUS! Since it is not yet opposite day, you don't have to take the opposite of the statement and so can take it at face value! Do you care, Loyal *gnat/cricket sound* Reader? *stunned* You don't!? Why ever not!? It is the most important discovery since...since...er...since...GRAVITY! (Although it is evil and squishying my spine...) How can you remain apathatic at a time like this!? The fate of mankind has been forever altered! Oh. Yeah...I guess you are right. I AM just rambling so that this Longest Text Ever gets even longer. But I DO care about this topic. There's not even a conspiracy! Well..fine! Be that way! Goodbye! I'm back *twitch* and seriously annoyed. Grrr...time to yet again complain about my *twitch* evil family. It is once again the time of year that makes entire families bond together...in the same sense that cats and dogs bond together when they have rabies. The time...is science fair time. My younger, eviler sister does a science project every single year. *twitch* The concept of science projects strikes fear in my mother's heart. She can not stand them. Naturally, this is why she takes over the project and does it for my little sister. Unfortunatly, this means that I am often called on for my "consultant" abilities. *twitch* In other words, I do the experiment, and think of all the results, and the wording of everything. I then interpret my work for my mother, who writes everything down because she has really, really obsessivly neat handwritting. Of course, my mother gets stressed merely handling paper that will potentionally be USED for a science project, so this is a very, very negative situation. Oh, and my mother refuses to even entertain the notion that my little sister might possibly be of help *twitch*. At this very moment my little sister is watching a Disney movie, while complaining of a headache. *twitch* My mother is getting more and more aggravated as I try to explain that my sister might fail if it looks like she didn't do the project. I am currently on strike. I refuse to assist this project in any further way untill my little sister does freakin' SOMETHING. Wow. Speak of the devil. My sister IS doing something. She is RE-WRITING everything my mother just wrote. Like mother like daughter. *twitch* I guess this is my mother's way to make sure the judges don't know that my sister didn't do the project. My mother makes my sister redo everything over and over again because it's not perfect enough for her. Now she is the one who's getting yelled at. I guess I can't help but feel sorry for my evil sister. *pauses* I guess I'll stop complaining, then. God...I have a headache...seeya. I'm back. *shakes head* And I have (yet again) a rant about the sheer weirdness of my family. Previously I have ranted about our fun-filled family outing to a bar, and about my non-gender specific siblings obsession with dead animals. Somehow, these two occurances have joined in an unholy union to create: The Roadkill Sightseeing Event of Doom! We actually went to a normal resteraunt for dinner, believe it or not. On the way back, my mother entertained us with the story of how she had seen roadkill that looked exactly like a dead bear. She had later compared notes with one of her wacko friends and they had decided that it was, in fact, a dead wild boar. We would be passing by it in a few minutes. Oh joy. My non-gender specific sibling (henceforth known as my sister) was naturally estatic about these events. She wanted to get out and see the boar. My mother agreed, and wanted my Dad to turn the car around so we could go to Wal-Mart to buy a flash-light. My father refused this. We ended up driving right past the supposed location of the boar, much to the dismay of my sister and mother...and dare I say it? Yes...I dare. My BROTHER was even interested. Faced with direct mutiny from all but me, my father wisely elected to turn the car around. We drove off the road and my dad aimed the car headlights at the boar. I must say, it wasn't that impressive. It was just a lump of black hair, and it was a lot smaller than any bear. My sister was impressed, and it was all I could do to keep her from jumping out of the car to it. My mother was disappointed, saying that the boar had seemed bigger in the daylight. My dad moved the car back and forth, so that we could see the boar on the side of the road more clearly. My mother became terrified and decided that we would flip and die. All to see a boar. After a few minutes, we drove away. My mother seemed upset that I had not been interested in her roadkill. I can't help but feel cheated. Normal families go to museums and theme parks for amusement. We view dead animals. There is something just SLIGHTLY wrong with this. It reminds me of the time a few weeks ago when my mother swore up and down that she saw a grave by the side of the road. This bothered her for some time untill one day she finally pulled over to the side of the road and exhumed the shallow grave and discovered that it was actually a deer. Luckily, I was not with her this day. However, she never leaves any member of our family in the dark concerning roadkill. It's just strange. Anyway, that's the rant for today, seeying as how there was actually a topic. Seeya! I'm back! Seeing how I will shortly no longer be (legally) a child, I have decided to rant about: adults. You cannot deny it. They are EVIL. Think about it! Come, on! Don't be shy! I'm serious. When you think of the evil, conniving, conspiratorial ways of adults, what's the first thing to come to mind? The nursery rhyme, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', right? Huh? You mean it's NOT!? How...bizzare, it's obviously a mechanism for brain-washing. Anyway, here's MY reasoning for hating the song (and many, many others). Mary Had A Little Lamb makes children resigned to accepting punishment that they don't deserve! You still do not see!? Fine, I shall elaborate. This poor little girl's lamb (with fleece as white as snow--an obvious reference to seeming purity) follows her to school one day (which was, oddly enough, against the rules). The kids at school, who were not used to seeing a lamb at school, started to "laugh and play" and basically act like wild animals. Now (this is all speculation) I am 90% sure that the final verse (which neither I, nor anyone I asked know) deals with the teacher reprimanding poor little Mary in some way. And for what!? The kid's pet followed her to school! How could she stop it, she probably never even thought to look behind her! Not only that, but poor little Mary would never, EVER do such a thing on purpose! Just listen to the SONG for cryin' out loud! The lamb followed HER! She didn't LEAD it! Now, sure, the teacher was probably on her last nerve. I mean, she's an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER. She probably doesn't get paid much, or gain much respect from her pupils. So, when the children pretty much went wild over the lamb, and she couldn't calm them, she was looking for someone to blame. And poor little Mary was a ripe target by then. Now, can you honestly picture poor little Mary arguing with her teacher? I didn't think so! Little Mary took her punishment, and her PARENTS were probably so upset that they got rid of her white little lamb. And for what!? A teacher's misbegotten pride? Adult supremecy? I ask you, knowing what you know now, could you (in good faith) read this to a young child (implicitly teaching them that it's best not to argue, to simply lie down and let those older than you walk all over you--for "your own good")? And another thing! You know the lullaby, 'Rock A'Bye Baby', the one about the baby in the tree!? What kind of SICKO wrote it!? This poor baby is up in a tree (not the safest of places) in the middle of a freakin' HURICANE! At the end of the freakin' song, the freakin' BRANCH BREAKS and the baby falls, "cradel and all" (presumably to its death). What about Hanzel and Gretel? It's nothing more than a huge threat! "Now, be good or we'll send you out into the woods to be eaten by the witch." What kind of twisted person does that to children? Ring Around the Rosy? It's a song about the Black Plague, the deadliest plague in mankind's history! When you first got it, you'd get a red spot with a ring around it (Ring around the rosy). During this time, people (mistakenly) thought that stench spread sickeness, so they'd keep "pockets full of posies" to ward of the stench of death around them. "Ashes, Ashes" was originall "Achoo-Achoo", because the dying would be particularly susceptable to colds. "We all fall down"? That's an easy one. We fall down dead. So, it's obvious that adults don't exactly sugar-coat everything they teach to children. I'm sure I can find more horribly EVIL examples, but I simply don't have the time. Now, granted, there are SOME (but not many) children's stories that are beneficial. Like Snow White, or Cinderlla. Those stories teach children to think for themselves, and occasionally completly ignore the adults around them (as long as they are Evil Step-Parents). Well...I'd better go. *blinks* I wrote a lot today. I suppose I should write other stuff...but...well...I figure you need the break to recover your sanity...*snort* Like you could do THAT! Seeya! I'm back! As I am writing this, I am in the process of adding a navigation bar to the Longest Text Ever. It still is as chaotic as ever, but at least this way people can find certain stuff easier. Like the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony info. Anyway, that's about all I have to say right now. Seeya! Gah! Fellow Flaming-Chickens, you must see the sheer cool paranoid thinking I have found! Wal-Mart is EVIL! A person (besides me) thinks this! Isn't that cool!? There is even a section on Wal-Mart Subliminal T.V. (tupperware, anyone?)! Anyway, this has been a short public service annoucement. As opposed to one of those long public service announcments that keep on going and going and going. I mean, they just never seem to stop, do they? Just when you think they are finally going to run out of steam, they just charge on and on. It's like torture, or something. Don't those kind of people realize that if they public REALLY cared about the topic, they'd do their own durn research, instead of listening to some self-important moron lecture them about how socially-irresponsible they are? Not that I'm trying to prove a point. Quite the contrary: I am merely extending the lenght of this Longest Text Ever to provide an ironic example of self-important morons who just won't stop talking. Isn't it entertaining? Don't you just want to here my entire life's story, starting from age 2? You don't? Well...perhaps I really SHOULD leave...what do you think? Er...well...seeya! Yep. I'm back. *traumatic pause* This weekend I went to go visit my future college. It was the most traumatizing experience of my life, to date. The day before I got there the college had won a basketball game and were going to the finals. This naturally caused parties to break out all over campus. According to one guy, a couch was "set on fire". *sigh* I was "hosted" (along with two other girls) by some bubbly, perky Greek (sorority (sp?)) girl. I hate her so much. She never shut up. She was so shallow. She wanted us to join a sorority, just like her. (all paraphrased) Ex. 1 "I would NEVER have passed my classes if I hadn't gone Greek". Ex. 2 "I just don't see HOW I would have, like, ya' know, managed ANYTHING without my sisters!" If I never see her again it will be too soon. Her idea of entertainment was to take us to the recreational center, sit us down in the gym and talk to her friends while watching the guys (badly, this IS an engineering school after all) attempt to play basketball. Apparantly all the decent players were at the final game thingy. Then she took us to the fraternity next to her house (we didn't even get to "experience" sleeping in an actual dorm). The fraternity was disgusting. There must have been 1000 flies, 100 beer bottles, 50 Bud Lite cans, and 5 creepy dudes who were attempting to practice music for some competition. After about three hours of this, I almost snapped. Me and another girl were supposed to be watching T.V., but due to the evil, out of tune, incredibly loud band, this proved to be impossible. My "host" and the girl who was enthusiastic about "going Greek" were swimming in a heated pool. The other girl (who also hated to swimn) and I started to talk. There was nothing else really to do. She hated our host and hated the fraternity/Greek thing too. We talked for awhile, and some dude joined us. He was cool. He was regional STAR student for another area. Somehow we got onto the topic of religion, and it turned out that the other girl I was with was Muslim, and was born in Egypt. It was cool. Anyway, it was just the two of us girls in the entire FREAKIN' fraternity (not counting the two swiming girls, downstairs. The floor was greasy, and oddly sticky--just like a movie theater. When our "host" finnally said we could go, it was close to 2 a.m. I barely got any sleep...grrr...not to mention the fact that we had walk to breakfast by 8:00 a.m. Oh. Silly me. I forgot to mention a key difficulty. We had to WALK EVERYWHERE! Uphill! (But not in the freezing snow, for 15 miles). You have not experinced Jenny's personal Hell untill you have carried your luggage (including a trash bag containing a sleeping back and the trash bags plastic handley-thingies are rapidly stretching out to become lethal weapons similar to piano wire) uphill, upstairs, across campus and up the four or five flights to the breakfast area, only to discover that, Oh! Gee, there was an ELEVATOR that the "host" conviently forgot to mention. Even more evil stuff happened, but suffice it to say that when I finally saw my dad at lunch, I begged him to just skip the final sessions because they were pointless (how to choose your major) and go home. He went ahead with his sessions, but let me opt out of mine and I slept for 50 minutes on some random couch in the lobby. Oh. And then the 6 hour drive home. *shudders* As you can tell, I am still seriously miffed about the whole experience. Sorry for ranting... Well...there WAS some good things about the whole experience. For one thing, it was the first time I'd ever been in a big city. The sky line was beautiful! Er...yeah...that was about it. Did I mention the uphill walking part? I did? Oh. Well. Then. I guess I'm done. Seeya! I'm back! And I'm here with a Vital Public Service Anouncment for all of my two and a half Loyal, Hypothetical Readers! Don't you feel all special inside? Oh. Yeah. The anouncment. BEWARE OF YOUR OWN FRENCH FRIES. That's correct. French fries. You see, it all started one friday afternoon *start wavy flashback sequence* My friends and I were sitting down to a tasty lunch of Skool Brand food. This included, tragically, french fries. Oh, what a fateful day. It seems like it was only yesterday when we were so carefree and innocent...when in fact it was actually only a few hours ago. You see, we inadvertantly started a mini-food fight that spilled over into a neighboring table, which also housed our friends. Said friends began flingning the aformentioned French Fries at us. I shudder to think of how we had laughed and frolicked and otherwise remained oblivious to the tragedy that had yet to unfold. For, you see...the french fires were...pointy...and hard. And Fate herself seemed to conspire against us (just like the Skool, government, evil cartoon owl, etc.) One single solitary french fry pierced my friend's guard and hit her on the nose with the sharpest, hardest tip a french fry has ever been known to produce. We calmed down, and thought nothing of our near brush with Death. After all, what can a FREAKIN' FRENCH FRY do, right? Ahhh...to be so young and naive again. Time passed, as it always does, and "Meg" noticed a speck of something on our friend who had been hit by the projectile french fry. The friend (Tonileigh, actually) wiped the speck, only to discover that it was blood. THE FRENCH FRY HAD DRAWN BLOOD! It was obviously an evil, voodoo french fry sent to assasinate her by the mysteriously evil Cafeteria Lunch Ladies who needed Tonileigh's blood for their accursed voodoo spells. Fortunatly, the quick thinking of "Meg" saved us all and the lunch ladies never obtained their goal. Oh. And here is yet ANOTHER VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE THINGY. Tag, you're it! These words have haunted nearly ever playground in existance. "Tag" is practically all a child learns in kindergarten. There is not a person alive who has not played some version of the game. And yet...what, exactly is "it"? When defining it for my Pronoun Quiz I reffered to "it" as something that "mankind has dreaded for centuries". What made me say such a thing. What is it about the unknown, mysterious and faintly ominous "it" that makes people dread it so much? Even the most innocent of children know that to be "it" is to be a virtual outcast of society. The youngest child knows that no sane person would want to be "it". Recently a group of TAB members, myself included, set about finding out what "it" exactly is. We conducted "field research" (we played a game of tag). When I became "it" I declared that I was touching the bench I was standing on so it became "it" and the bench was touching the ground, and the ground was touching everything on earth, except for airplanes and stuff but even the ground was touching AIR which was touching more air and so on and so on untill the very AIR was touching the airplanes and the airplanes became "it". So...the entire earth has actually been "it" from the first game of tag and WE JUST NEVER KNEW IT! I know, I'm just as shocked as you, Hypothetical Reader. *shakes head* And all along we had thought that we could somehow absolve ourselves of the burden of being "it" simply by passing it on to another. But that is not true. We merely pass the awareness of being "it" on but never the actual quality of being "it". The question was raised: Where did the first "it" on Earth come from. It was a thought provoking question. Some thought that perhaps the first person to invent tag was the original "it". I, however, favored an extraterristrial origin. My current theory is that the meteor that supposidly killed off the dinosaurs was the original "it", and that it "tagged" the earth, thereby causeing the earth to be "it". The dinosaurs, of course, could not handle the burden of being "it" which resulted in mass suicides. The mammals, being nothing but idiot rodents at the time, couldn't care less about being "it" and eventually forgot all about it. Until, that is, some half-remembered special memory popped out of some five year old's brain and he/she invented tag. Some people found holes in my theory: How did the meteor become "it"? After much discussion and deliberation, we came to a group consensus that the so called "Big Bang" was actually all the players of the game scattering. Similar to the beggining of a game of tag or hide-n-go-seek. The players begin huddled together, but when the game starts they scatter and flee from the person/planet/rock who is "it". The only difference I can think of is that rather than passing the "it"ness on, the players merely add to the number of people who are already "it". My theory would also account for the current scientific opinion that the planets/galaxy/universe is moving away from the origin point of the Big Bang. After all, if there's no base, why return to where you started? You wanna put as much distance between you and your pursuers as possible. Critics wanted to go further, was anyone "it" BEFORE the Big Bang. My arguement is this: No one is "it" before you begin a game. Any "it" before the Big Bang was part a seperate game, and would therefore be considered a different "it" from the "it" that we fear so much. So I believe the question to be a moot point. *blinks* What's that, Loyal Reader? I have confused you with my trivalties? You do not understand my obsession with "it"? Shame on you, Reader! Haven't you learned yet that it's my JOB to confuse you and make no sense? Tsk-Tsk. Oh, well. Gotta go! I'm back, but only for about five seconds. Just a little side note here: Remember that rant I did about "pure" water? (don't even get me started) In it I mentioned that fast-food salt lists its ingredients, right? Well, here they are! *takes package of Burger King Iodized Salt out of pocket* Drumroll please...and the ingredients are: salt, sodium silico aluminate, dextrose, and 0.01% potassium iodide. Wasn't that painstakenly accurate? A hundreth of a percente of the salt was potassium iodide! You can't get much more accurate than that. Don't you think that "pure" water has much MORE than 0.01% of some random mineral? Why don't THEY list it, huh? *shakes head* *mutters* Evil, "pure" water companies... *wanders off muttering to self and acting like a crazy hobo* Seeya... I'm back! And I have yet another footnote to a previous rant! You remember that "infinite possibilities" rant? Here's a quote from a supposed Time Traveler: "Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere." I love it! Here's another one: "On a philosophical level, the existence of multiple worlds implies a moral balance in the superverse. For every worldline you perform a good action, there is a worldline where you perform a bad action. There are no good and bad people, just good and bad decisions. We can only be responsible for what we do as individuals on the worldline we are on now. " These are all exactly what I've been thinking of when I first came up with my infinite universe thingy to tell my little brother when he was bored and wanted his head to explode! Seeya! I'm back. And I just wanted to say that I went to Islands of Adventure (in Universal Studios) yesterday. It was incredible! If you wanna here about the awesome rides, (esp. the Spiderman ride, best 3-d effects and vitual reality I've EVER seen...) just click here. *shrugs* This way, if you don't wanna here me rant about it, you can here some guy PAID to rant about it rant about. But if you don't want to, you don't got to. Seeya! I'm back! Wow...*shakes head* My mother never ceases to be amusing. Since today IS mother's day, I shall devot this text to her...even if it is a bit of satire or whatever. You see...my mother has found a new "religion". She is reading some book written by some bimbo who has been to "the other side" and conversed with her "spirt guardian" or whatever and decided to share her "relevations" with people willing to pay a lot of money for garbage. At least...that's my opinion of it. My mother, however, takes it all VERY seriously. For instance, today at our (almost normal) dinner out she instructed me on the way to get to heaven. It involved opening a door. Seriously. Anyway...apparantly once you perish in this realm you are taken to a set of doors. The door on the right leads directly to heaven (do not pass "Go" do not collect $200). The door on the left "zaps you into someone's uterus" which, loosely translated, means that you get reincarnated. This is the "bad" choice. I know this because my sister expressed an intrest in being reincarnated and my mother looked at her with an expression of horror and said solemnly that if she did that "God would never forgive" her. She then proceded to tell us that if you were reincarnated you had to live out multiple lives until you were ready for heaven. *shakes head* Maybe I'm missing something, but if "God would never forgive" someone who innocently chose the wrong freakin' door, wouldn't that indicate that such a person would be barred from heaven forever? Isn't there just the SLIGHTEST bit of inconsistancy here? Why would somebody get punished by randomly choosing the wrong (apparantly unlabeled) door? Look. I don't mean to offend...~.< If you happen to be part of this religion (which prophecies Elvis's return sometime this year (2004) as "a blond hair, blue-eyed boy") then that's your choice. I definitly don't want to get in any theological debates here. So...I'll move on the a relatively safer topic. The National Enquirer. They're obsessed with Elvis, too, for some reason. I just don't understand why people care. I mean, Elvis is always reported as being: abducted by aliens, frozen in a tube in Area 51, having a brain transplant and is now the Pop-Star Britney Spears, and stuff like that. One song I've heard even equates Elvis with Jesus, for cryin' out loud! ("You're no Jesus, You're no Elvis" (From Megolomaniac, by some band). Why do people obsess over that poor, most likely dead, man? The world may never know. ( And don't even get me started on Tootsie Roll Pops). Anyway, I guess my point is that the book my mom is reading has a similar dedication to accuracty, hard-hitting facts and common sense as the famed National Enquirer (which confidently predicted several months ago that Michael Jackson's "secret Muslim bride" would exonerate all charges of child molestation against him. Which, in case you live on the moon, has NOT happened and probably never will). Anyhoo, that's my rant for the day...I'll probably post something in l33t eventually...seeya! I am back. (REAL introduction: Heh-Heh…I had ANOTHER sugar rush. And I was just a little bit hysterical. The following is my intro I wrote while sugar rushed, and various messages I sent to people while in the same state. Don’t worry if you can’t understand it…you aren’t supposed to. *sigh* The whole thing is just a blur of those wiggly red lines spell-check uses to tell you that stuff is spelled wrong…) I back! hee-hee! here is ANother sugar coated rant! and I am typing the intro while still hyper/slepepy. you see, i drank Sobe energy drink, a cup of sugar (just sugar) and ate cake (yet agina, late at night). So this was the result in various messages I left random peolple.
        *giigleing * Heee0-Heeeee! Sugar isf so very good1 and so is Sobe energy drink (sobe stands for 'soper'! *wavres hand* you see, i THOUGHT that i had recovered because i am no longler laughing so much! But, as you can see I do'nt think I'm am quite baCK TO normal. yet. whatever normal is... i am swayinhg to an imaginary breeze!@ and i don't care that i amn missplesling so many workds. because i am sure you will figure it wout someohow. il am very creative with words. do you like sugar? why DILD you get all freaky like me when i ate suo much sugart. ? zI vcan'y believe that we actually did that to thos e magazines...we so stupid. erm...ummmmm...i sure do hope we remember all of this. don't forget: we owe the library $4 each. That was all spel;ed coirecltly because it was important. i want to sleep now. but ever ei nlsince i ate that cup of sugrar it is to tired t o sleep. imagineation that. er jd f....er...eum...ye ah. *scurnches up eyebrows* Heh-Heh...the Song of Solumnun. good wuvs EVERYBODY! those incompetent physics/stupid rays must have really hit ius hard! either (say it so it rhymes with neither )with an long "I" sound)) that or we were jhust especially suseptible to the thing-a-ma-bnobober.s will wyou right me cback? i hope so. it'll be especially great if you right me when you are all sugary, too. who says you need drugs or thwatherver to have fun? sugar is very cheap, and makes everything so very, very funhy. *slams hand on tasble* OUch. That hurnt . Iam still wet from the watergun fight. It rocked! All that shorrtting and stuff! I got so many head-shots...er...can your brother see yet? I'm sorry i hit his eyes...dozens of times in a row. It was just so fun! we should do that somethimg again. you guys weren't taking it very seriously , though... *snickers* Hee-kheee...funny stuff. I ate a CUP of sugar. mmmm...sugar...I wis swaying in the place. Sugar and me, we don't g et along so well since I react to it like most people react to beingg drunk or under the ijnnnclunce of other suttff. Oh, god...sugar. i'm gonnat add another sugar rant to the longest text ever (just two ever)!sand for people who dont' know me...know,...i do k not do stuff. It's just that sugar under the wright surcumstances is doin' stuff...
        Okay. Is done. Mike the Headlessc hickrn day is coming up! seeya later! I'm back. It has been a year since the Evil Graduation Post. Which means that this year I got to attend my OWN graduation. Woo. I must say that I was rather underwhelemed by the whole thing. *shrugs* Sure, the fireworks were spectacular...and there was BEAUTIFUL weather. Cool, (not sufficatingly hot) absolutly no gnats for the first time in YEARS, no rain, just nice, soothing speeches that made absolulty no sense. At one point, our priniciple yelled at the graduating class because we weren't listening to him. The audience (consisting of parents) booed at him. So the principal yells at the PARENTS! What was he THINKING!? It's a good thing he's leaving, soon, because otherwise he'd probably been fired. Anyway, I just wanted to warn you of the dangers of broccolii: It's a form of lichen/moss that grows abundantly on certain sectors of Mars. In recent years, it has been cultivated by farmers into a semi-toxic product meant to augment the on-going brain-washing of young children, with the sole purpose being to turn them into Young Adults. Seeya! I'm back. I'm just gonna be here for a little while *demonstrates with fingers* so you don't have to worry 'bout crazy, paranoid rants. I just wanted to mention that former President Reagan apparantly declared ketchup to be a vegetable. Isn't that GREAT! I love ketchup so much...I don't even like FRIES...I eat 'em 'cause they are a means to convey KETCHUP to my mouth...mmmm....ketchup. Oh. Poor, poor Reagan ( he died last week...) Hasta Luego (means seeya later) I'm back. *sigh* This dang chatterbot is taking up WAY too much of my time! There's constantly things that needed fixing, updating and improving! Bah! But, I'm obsessed, and I've always been interested in simulated artificial intelligence :) Anyway, I'm making her personality really paranoid (she's based on me). Here are her thoughts concerning cows: *glances around* Just between you and me: I think there is some sort of dairy conspiracy! Ah, the power of cheese! Think about it: they are trying to sub-consciously tell you that THEY hold the power...of CHEEESE! And there are few things more powerful than THAT! Plus, the so-called "dairy farmer's of America" who pay for the Cheese commercials OBVIOUSLY have a virtual monopoly on the whole dairy thing. They even require that cheese get that little "real cheese" stamp before anyone considers it to be REAL cheese. Have you ever tasted fake cheese? Anyway, my point is that it is getting increasingly harder to find the time to make new quizzes, (or add pics to that destiny quiz), and to make coherent entries into this longest text ever. *sniffle* I try, though! It's just that it's so FUN to teach PSOPC bot subtle things, that maybe one in every 1000 visitor will stumble on to! Like, when she accuses you of being on of THEM, and you say "yes" she starts to panic, and won't listen to you unless you say somthing to get her attention. Ahhhhhhh. Well, anyway, enough about my little obsession. No sense in boring you all with the little technicall details (frankly, pandorabots has the training interface done really well...there is almost no need to know ANYTHING about programming...which, frankly...I don't...^^;;) Er....I guess that's all I have to say now...I don't really have much more parnoid conspiracies or strange observations to make. Er...I guess I could discuss something that has already become obsolete. Have you ever been to subway? You have, *nods* yeah...I love that place, too. Anywaaaays, I went there once and I noticed a poster in the window. It showed people of every size, shape and color, all of them in little pics in little neat boxes. The text read: Different People Differnt Tastes. Okay. I could easily see what it was TRYING to say: There is something for EVERYONE at Subway (eat fresh). But my very first thought was: Whoa, hey, are they CANNIBALS!? Because I interpretted it to mean that different people TASTED differnt, and that's what the subs were made out of and why there was such a great variety. Er...I know, Hypothetical Reader...not the best example of my eccentric thought proccess...but it's the first one that came to mind. *sigh* You know, come to think of it, I bet I HAVE dwindled back down to two and half readers (if that). After all...look how LONG this thing is getting! And, well, quite frankly, people are mostly contacting me about PSOPC bot, the OFCEM or the Quizzes, and *sniffle* mostly ignoring this little (note the irony) page. Well, seey later! I'm back. And, for the first time in quite some time, I am truly pissed off...and this is the only way I can vent my anger. Gah! Well, I suppose you'll need to know some back story, huh. (WARNING: CONTENTS OF THIS PASSAGE MAY CONTAIN DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS OF HUMOR, IRONY AND SARCASM. READING THIS PASSAGE MAY CAUSE THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS: LACK OF INTEREST, BOREDOM AND A GENERAL SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT LIKE NORMAL RANTS ABOUT PARANOIA, STRANGE OBSERVATIONS AND FAMILY QUIRKS) To begin with, I JUST got a job as a cashier slave at K-Mart. NEVERMIND the fact that I've worked at the daycare for A WHOLE YEAR, just so I wouldn't have to work for my final Summer of Freedom. Apparantly, my dad does not want me to actually USE any of the money I made from my previous job to buy college supplies. Instead, he wants me to learn the horrors of minimum wage employment and induce me to to strive to succede in the college world. NEVERMIND the fact that my previous job gave me LESS money...I apparantly STILL need to understand that there is more to life than $5.50 an hour. GAH! I KNEW that most jobs sucked unless you had a degree (and even then, most STILL sucked)! Why bother to teach me THE SAME FREAKIN' LESSON AGAIN!? Eh. I didn't argue, mostly 'cause my dad IS paying for most of the college expenses...so I am grateful. I just hate K-Mart. So...today was my biggest shift ever, from 3 pm to 8 pm. It's the latest I've ever worked, too. I know it's NOTHING compared to a full time job...but it's still enough to make me snap. FIRST OF ALL...well...there weren't a lot of customers during the first half of my shift. Blessing, or horrible boredom? In either case, I managed to obtain a Bag of Air from a purse someone bought, and (true to form) instead of discarding said air bag, I drew a face on it and decided that it was my pet, Bag. Oh, me and Bag had great times. I taught Bag how to return (I threw him at a fan and he blew into my face). I introduced Bag to a customer I knew (after they left and I was alone, even I knew that talking to a Bag is weird). *sigh* I hugged and squeezed Bag harder than I have ever squeezed a Moose, because I knew that Bag didn't have stuff like organs. The worst that could have happened that he would have exploded in my face, blinding me forever. Ahhhhh...Bag. Then...*sniffle* tragedy struck. I left my register to get something to restock the candy...and when I came back...Bag was missing! Frantic, I looked around, and saw, before my very eyes, a fellow cashier puncture my precious Bag with a key! They had thought that Bag was garbage! I had customers and so I had to deal with them, with a false smile plastered painfully on my face, while all the while I was repeating over and over the horrible scene. Once the customers left (after what seemed like an eternity) I rushed over to wear I had seen Bag. He wasn't there. I looked in the garbage can...he wasn't there. I looked in some nearby boxes...he wasn't there. I couldn't ASK the other cashier what she had done with Bag...no one at K-Mart knows my true weird nature yet. So...I regretfully had to forego giving Bag his needed funeral respects. We had some good times together...and we had JUST started to bond when his life was ended. I knew that it would happen, eventually. Even if I had managed to bring him home, I would eventually have lost interest. Bag was the perfect companion for my boring hour and a half. But Bag was no more. As the time dragged on, more and more customers came. During the last hour, the customers started to dwindle off (cool word, huh...dwindle...say it! Dwiiiiiindle...) I was once again left bored. I eventually grabbed a piece of cardboard (hmmmm...that came discarded from a bag I sold, too...coincidence? I think not!) and started to draw a cute little bunny and a tiger...(GAH! I think I left that at the register...I bet that EVIL other cashier is throwing it away, right NOW!). I was able to draw in peace for a while, with only the most minor of customer interruptions. Then...the other Cashier went on her brake. We are allowed 15 minutes for our breaks. She went 17 minutes before I my shift was over. Can you guess what happened? *sigh* I HAD been planning to close up shop at about 7:53 and clock out on TIME for once ( I usually close when I'm supposed to leave and end up clocking out 5 minutes after). So...I am looking forward to doing a little shopping (for hand-held Nerf guns) before my parental unit came to pick me up. So, predict, if you will, what happend exactly 10 mintues before I was going to close. You can't? Well...let me tell you: EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STORE APPARANTLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE. Not all at once, oh, no, they were more subtle than that. At first, all I felt was mild annoyance. I even thought, oh, I guess I won't finish my pic. Then, ten more people were in the line. I thought about asking the last person to prevent more people from entering, but I though, Hey, why bother? It's not as if there can be many more people in the store, right? Wrong. As I widdled (another cool word) my way through the customers, MORE KEPT COMING. After barely having any ALL DAY, all of them swarmed like a hive of malevolent bees. GRRRRRR... This time I DID ask the last person to keep others out. Everyone seemed to be amused. I was the only cashier, where would other people go? I explained that they could check out at the service deck, which was an exhausting 25 ft away (I was more polite though). Finnally. It was 8:05 and I was on my last customer. I was irratated that I wouldn't have enough time to get the Nerf gun, but other than that I was just eager to get home. Ahhh...those last customers. I think they were sent just to try my patience. First of all, they bought a few expensive items. They gave me a gift card, and they still had $59 left to pay. They tried to pay with credit, but it turned out they didn't have enough dough in their account to pay. So, they wrote me a check for half the ammount, and then tried to pay the rest with credit. The credit machine froze. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I walked those hazardous 25ft to the service desk to ask for assistance. I waited while the person delt with a customer. I heard someone call my name. MY customers were frantically gestering to me. So I walked back. It seems that they had overestimated their credit account. BUT, their boyfriends showed up and gave them 5 bucks, so they gave THAT to me and then paid the rest with credit. They left, I closed up. I shut my register off at 8:20 pm. I glanced outside and saw my parental waiting on me. I angrily stalked all the way to the back, and clocked out. Then I stalked back and got in the car, at 8:30pm. I was furious. I had suppressed ALL emotions while actually working, but as soon as I stepped away from that register my dam broke and I was awash in them. Gah! Suppression of self (my technique for dealing with any situation involving strangers) just applified my anger by suppressing it. By the time I got home, all I wanted to do was mutilate and slaughter helpless animals on my favorite video game (supposidly, the point of the game is to save the world, but I just like shooting the life like animals). Of course, when I got to the PS2...the game was not there. I had left it in my OLD PS2 that I had taken with me on my vacation. The PS2 is in a box, right next to me at this very moment. The game is inside it. I COULD plug it in and obtain the game...but by now I have mostly excorized my emotions by reliving them by adding to this Longest Text Ever. I KNOW it was a petty thing to get angry about...but I didn't want to job to begin with. (And poor, poor Bag...) I never WANTED a job where you might not get off on time...like my friends always complained about McDonalds. Like them, if there are still customers...I can't leave! To make matters worse, it doesn't even feel as if I am working for money, since all I earn goes in a bank account for my future use. I am present oriented! I don't care about some hypothetical future! It's as if I am working for the sole purpose of making my dad happy. Eh...well...enough whining from me... Seeya. Hiya! And I have a GREAT conspiracy/paranoid rant! Don't you just feel all warm and gooey inside, like melted cheese? Suprisingly enough, this is the topic of today's rant: cheese. Mmmmmmmm...cheese. Mild Cheddar, Mozzerella, Feta, Montery Jack, Colby...Mmmmm...or what about that Queso Blanco they use in Mexican resteraunts? Mmmmm... I love cheese, and chances are: You love it, too. There are even commercials, just for cheese. Not even a particular BRAND of cheese, just the entire CONCEPT of cheese. "Ahhhh, the power of cheese!" And I couldn't agree more. But...it HAS come to my attention somehow or another that this is and EVIL arrangement. Think about it for one moment. Have you EVER seen a commercial urging you to buy, for instance, burgers? Just burgers. In general. No mention of McDonald's or Wendy's, or those frozen Bubba Burgers. Just...ya' know, the CONCEPT of burgers? How about pain medication? Bannanas? Milk? Ah! There we go. Milk. Just about EVERYONE has seen those GOT MILK? commercials. Every school in my county has a cafeteria chock FULL of posters of celebraties with milk mustaches, with the logo: GOT MILK? Hmmmmm...sooooooooo...just WHAT do CHEESE and MILK have in common? Let's see...BOTH are owned by the United Dairy Farmers of America. Hmmm...and it seems that OTHER countries have similar such organizations. In fact, there is even a CHICKEN Farmers organization (although apparantly it is not United). But other food stuffs organizations just don't seem to be as active as these mysterious dairy farmers. Hmmmm... Why bother to advertise a product, without bothering to promote a single company or brand name? Wouldn't you think that the companies could handle the advertising themselves? I know Kraft does: *sing*K-R-A-F-T. And lots of companies harp on the ammount of calcium in cheese. Sooo..why do the FARMERS advertise milk and cheese? Is it all a vast conspiracy? After all, this mysterious, spooky organization owns ALL THE CHEESE. Shocking, isn't it? So, this complete monopoly of the cheese world controls virtually all prices for all cheese/dairy items, including: Cheese Pizza, Ice Cream, Milk, Cheese, CheeseBurgers, Tacos, Cheesy Bread, Cheese Doritos, Nacho Cheese, Butter, Etc. (Etc. is not actually a dairy product, consisitng mostly of an ecletic mix of random items, but I figured that it would work to show the continuing theme of dairy type items. ) Why does the government allow such a monopoly to exist? Are they FUNDED by the government? Let's see *does a google search* Ooooo! Pay Dirt! I'm not the only one to see the evils of Got Milk! THIS SITE has an arcticle about the anger of small dairy farmers for the monopoly of the "Got Milk?" people. Jeff Manning, Executive Director of the California Milk Processor Board is apparantly in charge of this. What a strange title. Hmmmm...*scans the article* Oooo! They notice the non-brand-specific advertising! And it says how they are funded: "So-called “generic” advertising programs such as “Got Milk?” and “Ahh, the power of cheese” are funded, in part, through the congressionally authorized dairy checkoff, which places a mandatory assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight (roughly two cents per gallon) on all milk domestically produced and marketed commercially. Last year, the dairy checkoff raked in more than $250 million in hard-earned dairy producer money. " Soooo in essence, they ARE funded by the government (or at least in the sense that the government STEALS the small dairy farmer's money to pay for the ads). And they were sued by a small farmer who said: "We’re against having to fork over a huge portion of our bottom line for advertising that says all milk is equal." So they don't WANT to pay for the ads, but the government (and that California Dairy thingy) say they have to. Ha! That's hilarious! These stupid Dairy Conglomorate people are actually PAYING a town to rename itself "Got Milk" with those small dairy farmer's money! That's so pointless! It's like they are having these HUGE brain-storming sessions to see how they can best squander those small dairy people's money! "Hmmmm...Bob, why don't we buy all those "Largest Block of Cheese" roadside attractions and make a monument with them, entitled 'Ahhh, the power of cheese!'?" "Brilliant, Ted! But, I'd like to go one step further! Let's make an entire CITY out of cheese!" "Bob, that's it! Wait...wait! I think I GOT IT! Let's BUY a CITY the idiot yokels to CHANGE THEIR NAME TO GOT MILK! That way, we can still have those cheese ideas to fall back on afterwards!" *shakes head* It's so pathetic. *does happy dance* See, here I was ranting and raving about this, and it turns out that there already ARE people outraged! It's like that rant about the smoke detectors, and later I saw a movie about spy cameras in them. Or that Grape Pie Rant that ended up with me doing a google search months later (When I was bored) and discovering a pic of it...mmmm....grape pie. It's incredible how many strange things I can get outraged about, only to discover that they aren't strange at all! Well...seeya! Wootage! I'm back! And I have a new rant about the evils of parental brain-washing during childhood. Consider it a combo of the "Tag" rant and the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" rant. *shudders* How could I have missed such obvious implecations!? Gah! I shall focus! Alright...the subject of today's whatchamacallit is: Duck, Duck, Goose! It is EVIL! Now, I KNOW that most of what small children learn is actually not-so-cleveraly disguised brain-washing attempts, but this is just plain wrong! For those of you not familiar with the game, let me summarize. One child is "it" (JUST like in Tag). This child, labels each of the children, usually as "duck". The other children are sitting in a circle, and the "it" child walks around tapping their heads, going: "Duck, Duck, Duck"... Simple enough, right? Ah, but THEN the "it" child picks somebody ELSE to be "it", and tap the unfortunate victim on the head, crying "Goose!". Then the "goose" must pursue the "it" one and attempt to tag them. If they do not tag the "it" child, the "goose" becomes "it". If they succede in tagging them, the "it" child goes in the "mush pot" and the "goose" becomes "it" anyway. Alright. Now you know what the game IS...let's move onto what it MEANS. First of all, the game is CLEARLY a mock witch hunt. The children alienate and ostracize the one who is different, the one who is a "goose" when everyone else are "ducks". The "it" child is the current pariah, and obviously wants to exchange situations with a more fortunate child. So, the "it" child desperatly accuses another of being a "goose" (just as condemned witches accused others of witchcraft in order to alleviate their sentence). The child, symbolically shocked and appaled by such wild accusations, denies it, and even goes so far as to pursue the accusing pariah. If the accusation is deemed false (i.e. the "goose" tags the "it") then the accusing "it" child is sent to exile (the mush pot). HOWEVER, the taint of suspicion is already upon the former "goose" and despite protestations to the contrary, the child is the new "it" pariah. And the game continues. This game is DESIGNED to teach children how to shun those who are different, and to ostracize them from society if neccessary! How can this POSSIBLY be one of those little life's lessons that children must learn to become Responsible Adults? *shakes head in disgust* Well, anyway, that's it for today! Seeya! I'm back! *giggles wildly* Woot! I have something EXTRA SPECIAL for you loyal readers *cricket chirps yet again...what is UP with that?*! "Meg", the inspiration to that Pointless Signs of America Rant, has "agreed" to do a rant for us! It's GREAT! *giggles* Well, here it is: "Meg" here. Jenny has kindly asked aka threatened me to do a guest rant, and I am only too happy to oblige. So here I am ready to inform you of silly things! Let's start! Go! Go! It has come to my attention that Barbie has finally found a new love. That's right. Bye-bye to boring Ken! Here comes Australian surfer Blaine! At this point, a few of you will be screaming: "No! Ken and Barbie forevaaaaa!" An insane percentage of you will be going: "Oh, that is so cute, Barbie and Blaine! That's great cause, like, both of their names start with B! Heehee!" But most of you will be wondering if that leftover pizza a week ago that is still in the fridge is eatable. Trust me on this, it's not. So why am I bringing this up? How many of you remember playing with Barbies? (The guys reading this.pretend it's G.I. Joe and his buddies.) Remember when you ripped off Barbie's head and it gave that satisfying pop? And how there was always one Ken doll and a whole bunch of Barbies? And Ken had to choose from his little harem which one he wanted? It was actually training to make you used to Reality TV! The Bachelor is eerily similar to the game you played as a child. Ken has to choose between Vet Barbie, Cowgirl Barbie, Teacher Barbie, and Dolphin Trainer Barbie! There's also a million dollars thrown into the mix! (Guys: G.I. Joe has to decide which of his buddies to vote off the island or something.) Ken was always a favored one! But now with him gone, (Barbie was quoted saying something like, "So long, ya pansy!) how will young girls (and boys) tolerate Reality TV when they are older? Mattel and TV producers are realizing their mistakes, so they decided to hold a vote for the "new man" of Barbie. This vote again was a little Reality TV thing in progress. The Bachelorette this time. Who will Barbie choose? The trendy new guy she chose which, over 2 million people decided, was Blaine. Now, girls (and boys) will be racing to get him and the many clothes and surfboard accessories he will undoubtedly have. Marketing goes up, and a new generation of potential Reality TV watchers is created. The endless cycle continues. I hope you enjoyed my rant! And remember! May Blaine always help the masses decide: American Idol Barbie or Survivor Barbie. Wasn't that GREAT!? *giggles* I luvs it! Ahhhh...the joys of paranoid conspiracy ranting without any of the effort! Go, "Meg"! Well...er...seeya! Well, I’m back! *waits for applause* … … … … ANYWAY, today I am here with a very special treat for you loyal *insert random insect noise here* readers! Don’t you feel extra squishy? I’m here to “advertise” a wonderful product found ONLY (to my knowledge) at K-Mart (where I am a Cashier Slave of questionable Loyalty). Okay, here goes the commercial I have prepared: How would YOU like your four-year-old sibling/cousin/offspring/neighbor/pest to have ALL the fun and excitement of BIKING with none of those annoying little distractions, like being able to STOP at will? Well, you are in luck, Hapless Victim, because have WE the bike for YOU! Introducing the Tyke Byke (not actual product name) now with 100% less brakes! Wasn’t that fun AND entertaining? Seriously, though, I was bored and waiting for my shift to start (we can’t clock in early) and I happened to wonder into the bike section. And I found a box with a picture of a happy little girl on it, wearing her helmet. The box listed features of the bike, and (off to the side, in one of those happy little many-pointed stars where they usually write stuff like FREE!) was the words No Brakes! Like this was a GOOD thing! What the …? I thought brakes HELPED YOU! And to think, after all these years I have been wrong!? But seriously, can you IMAGINE the Marketing committee that designed this thing? I figure it was made of, say, Hitler, a cannibal, Satan and Mary Poppins (anyone else creeped out by her?) Here was their justifying equation (which I obtained through highly classified means, namely, a squirrel, a pack of walnuts and a mini-camera) Toddler + Tyke Byke + highway = hours of fun! I figure they WANTED small children to go careening into random objects. Why else would they give ‘em no brakes? Anyway, I better go, I have this GREAT idea for a gun without a safety, and a very sensitive trigger. ..Wow..I"m back......it's been an entire year...and here I am again...pointlessly ranting and raving. Today's topic is Quaker Oats! You know Quaker Oats, right? Do a google search and find a picture, I dare you. Chances are you'll find a creepy looking older white guy dressed all old fasioned...if that's not bad enough: read on. It turns out that Quaker Oats OWNS the Aunt Jemima syrup company. Aunt Jemima is symbolized by a middle aged african american woman. Now, let's think....hrrm...the time frame that the Quaker Oats guy is from...plus owning a middle aged african american woman...wait a minute! Are they implying that she's a slave!? What kind of public image are they trying to portray here!? The NERVE of that company! *shakes head* They really need to have a better publicist.... Ah well, there's your LTE rant of the day/week/month/year/insert time frame ehre. Enjoy ^^ Heh, well, I’m once again back. This time from a long hiatus involving College life, kiwi’s and cannibalism ^_^ But let’s ignore that for now, shall we? Today we have MUCH more important things to discuss ^_^ Like a certain warranty on a certain pair of a certain headphones at a certain store that a certain someone works at a certain summer after returning from a certain college. Like most warranties, it guarantees the safety of the product for a limited time, and promises you fame, fortune, and your money back if it breaks during that time. That, however, is where this warranties similarities to the norm cease. Are you ready? *waits* How ‘bout now? *wait wait* STILL not ready? Bah, forget you, I’ll go on anyway. *clears throat* I shall now paraphrase the warranty to you, in all it’s arcane glory and splendor. This warranty shall not be in effect in the cases in which :

        1.) The product is purposefully damaged. 2.) The product is accidentally damaged. 3.) An act of God damages the product.
        ……….*pause for effect* There you have it folks. This beee-autiful warranty will NEVER be in effect. It just won’t. No matter what happens, the company issuing the warranty can just blame it on God. I can just see just such a scenario playing out in my head…….*wavy thought lines scene transition indicating an imaginary scene*

        Ted: Yes, I’m calling to cash in on my 90-day money back warranty?

        Customer Service Agent: *snicker* Oh really? *polite, polite* Would you please describe the damage or malfunction your purchase is experiencing?

        Ted: …it just stopped working.

        Customer Service Agent: *dripping with phony concern* Oh, gee, sir…but it seems that “just stopped working” falls under our “Act of God” clause, and our company cannot be held responsible for any vendettas that God may have against you.

        Ted:…………….you’re telling me that because God hates me, my headphones stopped working? And that you won’t give me my money back?

        Customer Service Agent: *can’t hold it in any longer* *laughing until they gasp* Oh…God…that gets me every time…*gasp* *giggle* That’s just great….Sir, I suggest *wheeze* That you go to Church…*snicker* And see if you can’t convince God to fix it for you….*guffaw* Because…you’re waaaaaaaay more likely to get him to reimburse you then us! *hangs up*

        So, you see? I am extremely impressed by this quick thinking company. If only I, too, could think of a way to so totally, and successfully scam my customers. Oh. Wait. I do. Every day, ……darn those Customer Service Plans! How stupid does a customer have to be to think that they should pay $20 now to insure their purchase of some stupid grill? If it breaks it would probably take 10 bucks to fix it. *sigh* Why must K-mart compromise my honor? Ack! I spoke its name! *flee* Alright I'm Baaaa~ack! That's right. Back from the dead like a fiery phoenix of nonsense and ranting, I return from months and months of not posting (and to make things even more interesting i won't mention anywhere else on the site that I made a new lte post!) So, today's topic is just on the concept of writing. I go to a very math oriented college (i'm gonna be a programmer) so the people here....just....really...suck at writing. Completely! *happy* So for a small nominal $50* fee I shall teach you, the Hypothetical Reader, how to write grade A quality stories, guaranteed! ** (* $50 shall be payable in invisible, imaginary Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony's Dollars (approx $1 OFCLC is $1,337,000,000,00 in US dollars, circa 1957) ** not a guarantee) So are you ready? Let's start with a basic story even a kindergartner would write!

        Once upon a time there was a princess and a witch was making her sad but then a handsome prince came and killed the witch and made the princess happy. really happy. i mean really, really happy. sometime three or four times a night. and they lived happily ever after.


        What a touching story, right? Let's see here, what basic story elements are we missing...Why don't we check the formula for a successfull story, shall we?
